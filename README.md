> Reddit Image Downloader  

**reddid** is a simple command-line app written in Node.js that lets you download images from image-based subreddits on [Reddit](http://reddit.com), using their [API](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api).

At the moment, it supports all image formats on Imgur, but not albums or galleries.  
Looking to add support for more providers.
