Holy shit, looking back I dodged a fucking bullet. I
nearly ruined my life because of porn addiction,
thinking I actually wanted to be a woman. The only
lasting legacy is I still wear panties.
I'm happy with where I am now, but it still
confuses the fuck out of me that I went on such a
trajectory. Am I so weak minded that I just want to
imitate what I see? Pic related, it's what I could
have fucking ended up like.
