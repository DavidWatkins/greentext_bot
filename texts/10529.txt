I think he might have actually done it...but
I'm not sure. He could have just faked it
and just went off the grid. Nothing comes
up when l google his name. Wouldn't it be
in an article if he really did it?
I wish I had some way of knowing. This is
really starting to bother me a lot. If it turns
out he did kill himself this will haunt me
forever.
Any advice? Anything I can do at this
point?
