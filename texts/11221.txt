Guys what the fuck did you do to me? I'm not gay,
I really am not, but this shit, oh this shit ls itjust
because I like the fact I look like a girl, so I'm just
atracted casually, or is there something wrong with
me? Will I end up getting a surgery? Will I end up
sucking dick? I'm telling myself that it can't happen,
but then again when I was 5 years younger I fucking
despised crossdressing. Is there any way to stop?
