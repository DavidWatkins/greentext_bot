After this event I stopped letting myself be such a shitty
person. Here's the story:
>went to local burger place
>l bust through the doors, each footstep loud and
terrifying as my legs just barely support my 340 lbs of
lard
>wagecuck at the register cracks a joke about my weight
>was about ready to sit on his toothpick ass
>order my burger - it's a long order and I realize how
much fucking food I really eat. It's disgusting
>other little wagecuck kid brings out my order
>take bite
>the dude's staring at me
>tell him he fucked up my order
>this kid goes into a full on mental breakdown
>demand a refund out of the manager and get out of
there
>he didn't actually fuck up my order, I just didn't like the
way he looked at me
>think about it late that night, wonder if that kid working
there was autistic and l ruined his day
>ff 2 weeks
>show up again, order the same thing as last time
>same dude comes out with my burger
>ohshit.jpg
>he remembers me
>the asshole part of me takes over and tells him he
fucked up my order again
>the tears well up in his eyes
>l can't help but laugh, I don't know why
>the kid notices something is up
>he lifts up my tongue to reveal the pickles I said he
forgot
>me I'm Bubble Bass and I get publicly shamed for
fucking with an autistic kid
