>got braces off a month ago. was
h A A scheduled to come in for them to
158 KB JPG take the "after" pics and get my
retainer that day
>sit on the stool, nrst picture is a no smile front and
profile picture, no problem. i can just give my
standard dead inside blank stare
>ok anon. please give me your biggest smile
>okay. it's just a fake smile. can't be that hard.
right?
>try for what feels like an eternity. it was more like 5
seconds in real time but my brain doesn't care
>my lips are quivering like i'm about to cry, i literally
can't force myself to fake smile
>nurse gives me a weird look because i probably
look like i'm having a stroke
>i give up and give it another try
>mumble "sorry, i'm not good at this shit"
>beet red at this point, sweat forming. and the
adrenaline is kicking in. really want to run away and
not look back at this point
>usually my social anxiety is manageable but holy
fuck i wanted to puke right then
>she asks me if i was okay back there. i reply
"haha. no just a little tired. i had a rough weekend"
>how come anon? did you just get off of work or
home from school or something?
>"no" fuck. now ijust disclosed that i was a NEET
loser
>haha okay. subject changes to something i cant
remember. she shoves mirrors in my mouth and
takes pictures of my teeth. eventually someone else
comes in
>we try on retainers. go over how to take care of
them and whatnot. no problems, i'm relaxing after
sitting there for a while
>after a while the First lady comes back in and says
"sorry anon, our sd card died and we'll have to take
all of your pictures again"
>Iizard brain kicks in again
>i'm far less nervous this time and the small talk
between the nurse and i eased my mind a little. i
manage to force a smile without the stroke this
time. the pictures still turned out embarassingly bad
but at least it's over with i guess
>go home and contemplate suicide
