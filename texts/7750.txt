I can give you the general rundown on my technique here
>Have realistic fake account, plenty of game time in free games, fake profile picture
>Hunting a desperate autist - i use Team Fortress roleplay servers
>Have it in your profile that you are deaf - this gets you out of using a mic and makes you seem
quite vulnerable, kicking in their white knight instinct
>Dont act overly girly in conversation, literally Just be yourself it makes it much more nautral and
friendly
>ask them when their birthday is, they will tell you and also ask yours, say its in a couple weeks
>keep up the ruse until Video game gifts
Also they will always ask you for nudes at some point. Tell him "I had a bad experience doing that
before, I only want to do that again with someone I truly trust"
He will then attempt to buy your trust with video games, but don't suggest this yourself, let him
come to that conclusion in his own
