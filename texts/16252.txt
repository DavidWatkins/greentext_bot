>A girl I knew in school was a total attention whore.
>Never arrived to class on lime and always made sure to make a huge
fuss about it.
>Didn't talk to her all that much but I did have a few conversations with
her
>Her wrists had cuts and burns all over them. she were t shirts so she
never hid them
>l asked her why she was hurting herself like that
>She said 'No one loves me and my life is painful' etc etc
>'No one loves you?' What about your parents or your boyfriend?
>Answer she gave me was something like 'They don't really love me'
or some shit
>Made a point not to interact with her too much after that. because
she's an attention whore
>End of the school year she came up to me and asked me ill wanted to
go somewhere with her that Sunday
>I'm not good with these situations so I couldn't say no even though I
didn't like her
>Sunday came and we went to the top of one of those tower car parks
>Just as we got to the top she told me that she wanted me to be here
as a witness to her suicide
>Oh shit. I thought. she was going to jump and she was going to iorce
me to watch
>Had I known she was going to do this shit I would never have gone
with her
>Not watching unless you do a llip. I said that to try and shock her into
realizing this was stupid
>Complete shock was written all over her face. She had thought I'd try
to stop her
>Ehh?l A-aren't you going to try to stop me?
>Nah, go ahead. If you really wanted to live you'd stop yourself.
>After a while she got down off the edge
She walked up to me afterwards and tried to hug me with tears in her
eyes but I told her I loved someone else. She asked me who and I told
her to read the first letter at every line.
