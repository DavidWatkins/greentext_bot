no matter how hard I try and it sucks
I try so hard to stay positive but the world never
rewards me for that and only gives me more shit to
be depressed about. Never think I'm good enough
to do anything that I'd want to do with my life.
What is wrong with me? I feel like i have completely
lost the ability to love.
