The thing is I always wanted to have a
kid and he's perfect. I love him like my
own son. I wish I could have a kid but
unfortunately I can't, I'm 10004: sterile.
If it wasn't known in my close family
they'd probably consider me a PDF
file. Is it really that bad to take care of
others' children? I can't have my own
and if it's my sister's kid it's still close
family, right?
