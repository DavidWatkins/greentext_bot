this isn't time shit like this happened. although this
was the first time I actually saw something. I've
been hearing random grunts and doors opening
and closing at night since my childhood in this
house.
yesterday I purchased a cross and an icon in a
church tl'm russianM've told a priest about what
happend and he told me to throw holy water on the
mirror and read the Lord's prayer before going to
bed every night.
pic related is the mirror from the bed
