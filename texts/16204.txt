wtf can tech illiterate normies just stay away pls. i like
to help people but not when they can't even help
themselves you won't learn how to write efficient
algorithms byjust taking the 'fast track' everytime. he
might be able to do something like copy and paste code
but it is always spaghetti and GL trying to implement it
in any way beyond the scope of the example.
