> Few months after his funeral, find my
brother who is now my sister sitting on my
doorstep after I came home from my night
coHege
> Severely bruised and bleeding from his
head
> Take him inside and do bandage
> He tells me that a close negro friend of his
negro step clad tried to rape him and his step
dad used to beat him and mom
> When he told my mom about this, she said
my brother was a racist bigot like his
grandfather and me
> So he left that place and started doing
strip shows in trap bars and all after getting
rejected for everyjob because he had no
employable skills
> Few days back that same negro friend
visited his bar and again tried to molest her
but the bouncers threw him away
> He waited for my brother outside and beat
the shit out of him with help from other
niggers
> So he ran to my house after that incident
without even dressing his wounds
> Now he believes that all this Liberal,
gendertransition bullshit was a mistake and
a lie presented to him by Mom and regrets
leaving grandparents for mom
