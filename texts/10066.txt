>l prepare forthe drop while the altitude's climbin'
>From the aircrah I jump to the Earth far below
>Wind whistling past my ears as I go
>I open my 'chute and reach solid ground
>A Soviet regime I now must pound
>Through wet helds and old towns I walk
>But once I see Moscow its hard not to balk
>A city great and fearsome the heart of my foe
>Soon my vengeance shall be all this place will know
>I stride upthe kremlin, kicking open the door
>Whipping out my twin pistols. I drop two reds to the floor
>Carnage soon takes over the building
>As I give my enemies a brutal gelding
>A new shot rings outr distinct from the others
>And I realise that soon there will be an end to my bothers
>I drop to my knees. chest soaked in blood
>Another shot rings out and I fall with a thud
>On the ground I lie knowing that l have lost
>Such a bitter defeat and my life it will cost
>l only hope that the future will be bright
>For peace is my last thought as I head towards the light
