> someone links me a video to Jiddu Krishnamurti
> listen to him speak for hours and hours
> he tells me if 1 want to know the truth of my existence I need to meditate
> sitting in my room trying to stop my thoughts entirely
> feel a gut wrenching fear in my stomach
> realize what I fear most is not having enough time to know the tmth
> come to the realization that truth takes absolutely Zero time
> realize that my entire life I've only been getting in my own way
> realize that all of life is an illusion
> this is a massive shock on my psyche
> experience who 1 really am as I'm transported to a timeless void in which everything and nothing exists
> return back to 'realityl crying because it was so beautiful
kid that's my enlightenment experience.
