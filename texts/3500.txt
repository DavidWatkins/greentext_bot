Reminds me of a story
>be me when I was in 5th grade
>Since in our district 5th and 6th had a
separate building things were new
>School just started
>Teacher was cool and wanted to
everyone to become familiar with each
other
>She told us we'd have a show and tell
presentation on Friday
>We were supposed to bring
something meaningful to us and talk
about it from a little bit
>When I went home I decided to bring
my 88 Goku action figure which was
really special to me
>Go to school on Friday with the action
tigure with me
>All the kids bring things like pictures
of their parents or grandparents,
trophies they won, sports things, etc.
>l'm the only kid with a fucking toy
>Teacher says, "OK Anon, please talk
about the thing you brought today."
>Show my action figure
>Go into a fucking 5 to 10 minute spiel
about DB and DBZ and how much I
love those shows
>lt's like I'm a nonstop machine just
talking endlessly about the show and
Goku as a character
>Teacher says, "That's great Anon. We
don't have that much time though" and
then calls the next student
>Everyone thought I was so weird
