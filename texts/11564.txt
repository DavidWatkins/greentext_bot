>3i4th ofthe way to my mom and see a woman shouting on the curb
>Think she was just on her Bluetooth shouting at someone
>See both her ears and there's no Bluetooth in them
> Immediately get terrified and say in my head 'llt's an insane ladyi keep walking like
the hood says"
> Being 13 l'm still curious so i look up and see her belly and it was like she put all
the world's drugs in there
> lvlfw she starts shouting louder
>lmmediately speed up to avoid a conversation with her
> I walk up to my friends near the bus stop and ask, "Hey. do you guys know that
lady back there is crazy?" in a calm voice even though l'm freaking out
> My friend replies with 'Yes. we've tried to ignore her"
> I told my mom about it, I've never been so quick to speed walk away
