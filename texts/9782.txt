I haven't talked to her since tthis was last
weekendl. I don't even know how to
approach this, and I can't even look her in the
eye. Plus, the dawning realisation that I've
farted in front of all my friends, family, the
family of my glf, and the families of my past
relationships, with no one ever saying a
thing, still hasn't sunk in.
