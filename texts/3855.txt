>as you open your porn folder, you get a tingle on your neck
>suddenly, the room goes cold
>it feels as if the universe has completely stopped
>you hear something
>it's too quiet tor you to be sure to tell what it's saying, butjust loud enough that
you can hear it
>as you listen closer, you can tell it's coming from just outside your window
>the closer you move to your window, the louder the noise gets
>out of nowhere, the leaves begin to rustle and you can just see something in front of the widows
>'la face? that can't be" you think
>you stop moving and stare at the trees
>the noise is back, but you can hear it now
