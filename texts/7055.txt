>kids get a few cows, break into the school at
night, and lead the cows upstairs

instead of a several inch drop plus their knees and
hips aren't built for shifting their weight down
stairs
>we come into school
>go on second floor
>there's cows and cowshit everywhere
>teachers herd everyone outside to the football
stadium
>we're stuck outside in the heat until they bring in
a crane, demolish part of the wall, and bring each
cow down one by one

punished, he just wanted to know who pulled it off
>5 seniors confess
>principal lied and expelled them
