>She's 5'3, 6l10
>Really nice ass though
66 KB JPG >We talk about a lot of stuff, music, tv
show, movies, basic stuff
>A lot of the time though she talks about how she really
wants to smoke weed and how she's getting really eager
to have sex for the first time
>At the beginning of October make plans with her to go
trick or treating since it'll be one of our last years before
we're really pushing the age limit
>Awesome idea sounds fun
>A week later she texts me asking if I wanted to go to a
small concert with her the night of Halloween instead
>"It starts at noon and ends at three but we can
probably hang around my house after until like 9"
>Neither of us have cars so I say
>"It'd just be easier to go trick or treating and get
dropped off once rather than getting a ride to the concert
and back and all that."
>She says okay, sorry to bother you about it
>Entire night trick or treating she looks disappointed
>Get a shitload of candy
>We get back to her house and her dad isn't home
>"So anon, wanna go to my room and trade some
candy?"
>"Hell yea"
>She starts taking off her costume while we're in her
room
>"Oh shit, sorry I didn't realize you were gonna get
changed first."
>"l don't mind if you watch anon"
>Laugh and leave the room
>She calls me back in once she's changed, her outfit
looks like she just threw the first things she saw on as if
she wasn't expecting to have to put clothes on
>Trade candy and leave
Good god I'm stupid
