>Mother is 2601bs but much
shorter
>Once a month they force me to go out and eat
with them
>They always try to be cute
>They are proud of their obesity
>They have 'props' they bring with them to every
restaurant
>For example, they find the restaurants menu
online then write it down on a huge piece of card
and pull it out at the restaurant and start saying
"big menu for big peoplet" and laughing while
everyone else is silent
>at the end of the meal my dad always squats
and rips his pants causing change to fall out
because he hides it there then says "we tip with a
ript"
>they always laugh at me for ordering normal
portions
LITERALLY humiliates me every time and they
don't care.
