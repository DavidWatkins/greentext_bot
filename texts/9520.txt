>l just ate some fried chicken
KEffcifg-lf?ffwbw >The breasts were juicy, and the
7. wltwkg buns were soft and warm
i , >Afterwards, the division manager
of the restaurant came up to my
34 KB JPG table and asked me how the meal
was
>l said I was satisfied. but the meal lacked a
certain Je Ne Sais Quoi
>He apologised profusely, and said he had
something to show me that would make up for it
>He lead me to the back of the restaurant, to a
room soaked from floor to ceiling in blood
>In the centre of it was a live horse, chained by all
four legs to the structural supports of the
warehouse-like room
>As I watched, employees of the restaurant out
large sections from the horse, which was whining
and screaming in horror, with the remaining
sections of it's body covered with festering sores
and a froth of sweat
>The restaurant employees took the chunks of
horseflesh and sliced them into pieces, then they
rooted around the bags of trash strewn around the
room to find discarded Chicken bones
>They quickly tenderised the meat with
sledgehammers and fed it into a machine which
formed the horsemeat around the bones, then they
breaded it and deep-fried it
>l asked the division manager why he had led me
back to this place, and he pointed at the steed's
rump
>The diseased asshole was puckering rhythmically
with terror. squirting pus with each convulsion
"we're just about to use that section, would you like
a crack at it first?"
>I quickly unzipped my pants and wasted no time
jamming my erect penis into the stallion's
defenceless asshole
>With each thrust, l donkey-punched the horse in
the back of the head, making it clench it's ass even
tighter
>l came just as the horse died
>l was delighted, The restaurant definitely went the
extra mile to make me a satisfied customer
