>Look inside my tendie pouch
>Empty
>Must have eaten all the tendies in last
night's feast
>REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
>Put on my starry robe and wizard hat
in a foul mood
>I can't search for the Arcane Tome of
Voiak on an empty stomach
>Fucking normies are gonna pay for
this
>Take to the road
>After a few hours, come across a
normie caravan
>The Chad caravan guards challenge
me
>Ordinarily I wouldn't waste my time
with normies, but no tendies in my
tummy have made me quite grumpy
>Unleash a torrent of magical pee pee
on the Chads
>They scream in anger and disgust
before charging me
>Fucking normies never learn
>Transform the piss into gasoline and
set fire to them
>My mood is lifting
>Stroke my beard in satisfaction as the
Chads burn to death
>The merchant normies who own
the caravan are crying in terror and
confusion
>Demand they give me all their tendies
and waifu scrolls
>They comply, terrified of my arcane
powers
>Give them a runic ball as payment
>Tell them to move along
>They make themselves scarce
>As the caravan grows more distant, I
hear explosions and screaming
>The runic ball was a bomb
>Whistling a merry tune, I continue
along the road, munching on my well-
deserved tendies
>I am a wizard
