>sexual thoughts of cute girls keep entering my mind,
literally dozens of times a day
>have to fight off each and every sexual thought using
my mighty might and unparalleled newfound discipline
>balls feel a bit weird
>all the woman at uni seem hotter than ever
>today, the slight stare at Stacy's revealing, toned upper
arm made my dick 62ch, erect
I don't know how much longer I can last boys, my brain
really, really wants its expected dopamine release... but...
I wanna say I'm emotionally feeling mildly better since
I've started. We all gonna make it bros... Remember to
just try and keep your mind over your cock.
