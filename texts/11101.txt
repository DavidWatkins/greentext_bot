That was two years ago and the pain is still the same as it was the daytsl it happened.
This has been especially bothering me today because my daughter would have been 6
today. Ive been browsing this board for the last few years and ljust wanted to say that I
love you all teven the trolls that will post herei and enjoyed the time i spent on this sites
Honestly. my fondest memories are of threads on this board.
As for me: latertonight I'm planning on committing suicide at a creek i used to take the
kids to. I'm guessing my friends and family will know why i did it.
See you on the other side, lr9kl.
Also: pic related. It's my wife and daughter about a month before my daughter died.
