I play competitive Smash Bros Melee. I'm not good at all but when
my third eye opens I can hard read my opponents moves and
become untouchable. Even if it isjust for a gamelstock. i can even
cross huge skill gaps against top tier players by using my third eye
perception.
I'm going to a national this weekend. How do I train my third eye to
be open by this weekend so I can see split seconds in my opponents
future and hard read my way to victory?
. >TLtDR OP wants to use his third eye and precogniiion to win at
