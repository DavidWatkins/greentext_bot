answer my calls

Figured she fell asleep or something and
was happy i could play fortnite instead so I
forgot about it for like 3 hours , then at 1
am I open Snapchat before bed and saw
the story of a friend we have in common
that shows both of them at a club and her
dancing with a guy that looked oddly
similar to a guy that always wanted to date
her in hs and that she promised me before
she wouldnt talk to we almost broke up 4
months ago cuz I caught her sending
snapchats to him
she gave me a bs excuse about being with
her mom but when I told her about the
snap story she ignored me and the girl who
uploaded the snap erased it, what the fuck
do I do? I cant go to her house at 4 am
and not knowing what happened it's killing
me
