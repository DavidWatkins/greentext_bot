Gimme gimme chicken lendies:
Be lhey crispy or from Wendys.
Spend my hardeamed good-boy points.
on Kid's Meal ball pit burgerjuinls.
Mummy Iifls me to the car
To find me tendies near and far,
Enjoy my tasty tendie treats,
in comfy big boy booster sears
McDonald's, Hardee's, Popeye's. Cane's.
But of my tendies none remalns
She tries to make me take a nappy.
But sleeping doesn't make me happy.
Tendies are the only iood.
That puts me in the napping mood.
I'll scream and shout and make a luss.
I'll scratch. I'll bile. I'll even cussl
Tendies are my hean's desire
Fueled by raging, hungry fire.
Mummy sobs and wails and cries:
But tears aren't tendies. rings or fries
My gond>buy painls were fairly earned.
To buy lhe lendias that I've yearned
But Ihere's no iendies on my platel
Did mummy think Ihal l'd inst ate?
"TENDlES TENDlES GET THEM NOW.
YOU FAT. UNGRATEFUL. SLUGGlSH SOVW
I screech while hurling Into her eyes.
My foul-smell bavrel4Nelling diaper surprise.
For she who is un>pooped an is she who remembers:
Never forget my chicken tenders.
