>at valentine's everyone but him got '
love letters from class and
schoolmates
>said he didn't mind
>the following years on valentine's day i
wrote anonymous love letters and slid
them into his lockers
>borrowed my mum's perfume and .
sprayed it on the letters and did the
lipstick kisses and everything I went all
in
He seemed to be happy to have
received letters for once. Then I played
oblivious when people asked who they
were from. I suggested it might have
been a girl that he likes and he did
actually end up getting together with
her for a while after that so maybe it
made him grew the balls to ask her out.
