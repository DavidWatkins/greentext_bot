>First project is an absolute Trainwreck.
>Requirements are just a bulleted list of features.
>No mockups.
>No user stories.
>No test cases.
>It's a massive fucking project with a woefully low
amount of resources and time delegated to it.
>Business Analysts still adding requirements 1
week before project is supposed to go to
production.
>They know nothing about software or how it
works.
>Think what I do is magic.
>Asks for overly explanatory labels on everything
becuase users are like 504-.
>Wants me to basically recreate Microsoft Excel
with all the same functionality. In 3 months.
>Mad when I told them it's not possible by myself
to be done in that amount of time.
>They have no concept of software development
principles.
>Environments are all fucked. Can't reproduce
bugs in DEV because it doesn't mirror TEST.
>Expected to do all the DevOps work as well.
No way this project is done by Saturday but they
don't listen. Can't wait until next Sunday when all
hell breaks loose. MFW.
