> die is feminine, so der Mann "the man",
but it's die manner? so a group of men in
german must be feminine? are germans
just that fucking gay?
>Der rock? a fucking skirt is masculine in
germany?
>Der junge, das madchen? so male
children are male, but female children are
not feminine?
How am I supposed to learn this language
when it literally makes no sense 9070 of the
time.
