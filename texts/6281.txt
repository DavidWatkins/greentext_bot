>just driving down the main road in my
little city, in a courtesy car
542 kB JPG >it's double lane in both directions
>driving in left lane, going the
speed limit
>it's 7:50, traffic is fairly heavy,
everyone going to work and what not
>guy in a light brown SUV behind
me suddenly starts to tailgate hard,
he's doing that "swerve in the other
lane" thing, as if to indicate he wants
to pass me
>there are vehicles beside me and
in front of me,just ignore him and
continue driving
>suddenly, he decides to drive into the
on-coming traffic lane, and passes me
on the left on a double solid line
>didn't even notice this until he cut me
off, almost scrapping the left front end
of my courtesy car
>puts his hand out of the window and
does a little gesture with his hand
>pull out my phone and snap a picture
of his plate, he sees this, and abruptly
turns left down a side road
>just happens to be the EXACT same
side road that I live on
>l turn onto the side road as well, his
vehicle is in front of me, he quickly
pulls his vehicle up onto the side walk,
gets out of his vehicle, looking like he's
some criminal thug, and ljust casually
drove past him recording him on my
phone, once he saw I was recording
him his face went from "tough guy"
to "ohshit.jpg"
>l pulled into a nearby public parking
lot, and waited for him to leave so he
didn't see where I live
>he quickly pulled drove away, never
to be seen again
Lol seriously. If I was in my own vehicle
with my dashcam this would have been
a great video to upload to youtube.
