I feel like such a fucking faggot, l literally
robbed my sisters youth and fucked up my
entire familyjust because I was felt it was
necessary to bully her innocence.
It plagues me every night and ever since
she ran away nothing has been okay.
Everything reminds me of her, it reminds me
of things we did together and games we
played together when we were kids.
I really miss my sister, I dont know where
she is and even if I find her I dont think
I can face her
I guess I deserve this plague of guilt it has
brought upon me
