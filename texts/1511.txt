They can't actually do anything, can they? She walked
in on me so technically she was violating my privacy if
anything. My ubereats account stopped working so I
can't place more orders to try to see her again and
explain things. Now I'm going to get in big trouble over
a simple misunderstanding. Fuck everyone on discord
who told me the naked man technique would work.
