Further necessary info, I live in a housing facility for
power plant employees. Behind my house is a
dividing wall at about 12 m and after it, Dense
forest for 18 kms with a railway line in between
somewhere around 4-5 km in. I live on the second
floor, houses below me are abandoned and one on
the right side is also recently abandoned. To left,
there is nothing but forest for 4 kms as well

streetlights while back has nothing
>Sipping my shake and enjoying cold chill on my
