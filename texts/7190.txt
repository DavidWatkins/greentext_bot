8 ' > .
and starts bullying
. ' l >l get fucking pissed off and tell him to
, leave
>he hooks a loogie tbooger in his spitl
onto my shorts
>l reel back and punch him in the gut with all my fucking strength
>he doubles over, lays on the ground, doesnt make noise
>this being the firsttime I fought back with a haymaker, I thought the impact would
make the "WHAP" sound from animu and he would go flying back screaming
>hejust laid down silently crying
>think I didnt hit him hard enough, didnt want to hit him again
>attempt to say "that was only half my power. Dont you ever disrespect me again
by spitting on me"
>instead stumble with my words and say: "that was half my punch power...dont
spitting"
>run away, have to sit on the pipe for the rest of recess and had to have a meeting
with the principal
Anyways felt good to win a tight but I fucking cringe whenever l think about it
