>60 to the beach at night to drown myself in the sea
'7 >Enter the sea and submerge myself
>As l'm about to die from lack of oxygen, pussy out
and swim back to shore
>Lying in the sand gasping for air, I suddenly
have an epiphany
>This beach is a popular holiday spot
>That means women have bathed in this sea
>That means I was enveloped by water that had
been in contact with women
>Women were indirectly all over me
Later, virgins.
