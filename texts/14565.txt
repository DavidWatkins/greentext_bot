This is my life now
i have been textlng her ever since she leR
We havenft mentioned the kiss or anything bin its obvious there's some kind of sexual tension between us.
ioortt think I fucked up yet but litnow i could eastlyfuck it up If l'm not careful.
ican't fucking believe that the girl i used to larp as rodents whh is now an unambiglously beautiful girl who seems to actually like the tar
at least want to bang meil have no ldeaifuckl
This is. i think, a happy story. because this is where h ends for now. she's coming back soon.
i just wanted to write all this otit because maybe writing h out will help me construct a coherent narrative of my own life for myself
because every time ltiy to think about this thing abstractly if: completely overwhelming.
Thanks for reading what I hope wasn'ttoo anticlimactlc of a long story
as amiss
