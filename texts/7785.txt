That's all l remember. i guess the neighbor heard
the commotion and called the cops. Just got
released from the er. I reasoned with her not to cut
internet. She's even gotten me nugs. tendies, and
fries for every meal todayl She cry's as she hands
them to me. and just mumbles 'sorry' or some shit.
Glad she's sad about how she treated me and
rarity.
