>the people you think are normal, who you think
have their lives set, who you think must be happy
because they have jobs, are married, have kids,
own their own house etc.... are actually worse
robots than any of you
>they drug themselves with psych meds to numb
their natural discontent with living such empty
lives
>their lives are so full of responsibilities, bills,
caring for their kids, etc that they don't even have
time to feel or think anything, it's literally just
workworkwork year by year
>they post happy marriage pics online to dupe you
guys but in reality they are utterly miserable and
having kids is a massive inconceivably endless
psychological and physical strain on your entire
life and five seconds of smiley hugs do not make
up for it
>in the moment, everything sucks, it's only in their
memory after they've forgotten all the frustrations
that they remember awww moments
>these normies wish they had the endless free
time of neets to explore higher interests in life or
just to goof off to their heart's content, they are
secretly envious of neets
>they got suckered into the system
unquestioningly and now they're stuck, knee deep
in debt and other shit they can't get out of, and
wish they took the carefree neet hippy way of life
>a simple conversation with them reveals how
undeveloped they are mentally, all they know is 55
conversational blurbs and small talk filler, try to
engage them in a serious discussion of life and
you get the prozac stare
>think about it, allithey.do.is.work
>that's their life, every day, and it never gets better
it's funny. this board is like the opposite of reality.
everyone you think is normal and happy is actually
miserable, and we are the happy ones.
