Anyone else here a Vampire? Not even a joke. I've
been drinking blood for a solid 9 years and feel
amazing everytime I do it. I salivate at the smell.
I have been having a ton of trouble finding people
to donate blood. My GF left me because during one
session she passed out and I didn't stop so she
didn't feel "safe" around me.
FML why is life so fucking hard for mel
Also we can talk about music if any of you want.
