out he's uncircumcised in a later incidenQ and begins pelting james with them
>He's hurling these at mach 5 speeds into him
>James falls off of the stool he is sitting on and brings the girl sitting next to him along too
>Neal walks around the table, picks up the paint and slowly empties it onro both James and the girl iit is apparent
that Neal does not give two shits about civilian casualtiesl
>The roar has stopped
>kids are all huddled into the corner aside from me, the two tards, and the poor girl caught in the mix
>Teachers signals for tardwranglers waiting ouuide, james and Neal are picked up and taken from the classroom
>Neal is in complete and utter peace while being carried away, he simply waves at me
