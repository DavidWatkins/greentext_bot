i don't know if i'll make it guys. this looked like my only
chance at ever being happy, and i fucking blew it. i don't
know if what she said about meeting again will happen.
probably not. even if she meant it, i don't know if i can
withstand years and years of this shit anymore. i'm
seriously contemplating suicide at this point. fucking shit i
almost made it
pic is how i feel rn
