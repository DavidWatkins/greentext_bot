me and the blob
I assume he had some sort of reflex thing for whenever he
saw a gym teacher because he suddenly put his hands up
and shouted:
sGIB YOO TEN
>He goes down on his hands and knees and does a bunch of
push-ups, probably more than ten
>All while urinating directly on the floor
>When he finally gets up the peeing had subsided and I had
pulled up my pants and apologized to the blob
>He says
sDANK YOO
>and walks away
>I get no recess for a week for the "peeing incident" and no
gamecube for a month
>The next time I see the downie he's wearing a red colored
paper crown that has "king of the potty" written on it
