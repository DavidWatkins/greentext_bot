>A liberal Muslim homosexual ACLU lawyer
professor and abortion doctor was teaching
a class on Karl Marx, known atheist
>"Before the class begins, you must get on
your knees and worship Marx and accept
that he was the most highly-evolved being
the world has ever known, even greater than
Jesus Christi"
>At this moment, a brave, patriotic, pro-life
Navy SEAL champion who had served 1500
tours of duty and understood the necessity
of war and fully supported all military
decision made by the United States stood
up and held up a rock.
>"How old is this rock?"
>The arrogant professor smirked quite
Jewishly and smugly replied "4.6 billion I
years, you stupid Christian"
>"Wrong. it's been 5,000 years since God
created it. If it was 4.6 billion years old and
evolution, as you say, is real... then it should
be an animal now"
>The professor was visibly shaken, and
dropped his chalk and copy of Origin of the
Species. He stormed out of the room crying
those liberal crocodile tears.
>The students applauded and all registered
Republican that day and accepted Jesus as
their lord and savior.
>An eagle named "Small Government"
flew into the room and perched atop the
American Flag and shed a tear on the chalk.
>The pledge of allegiance was read several
times, and God himself showed up and
enacted a flat tax rate across the country.
>The professor lost his tenure and was
fired the next day. He died of the gay plague
AIDS and was tossed into the lake of fire for
all eternity.
