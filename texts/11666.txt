>12 years old
>go to stay with half sister a state away for a couple
of weeks
>while there some of her friends come over to play
cards and shit, they bring their 15 year old daughter
with them
>we instantly hit it off, spend time playing Primal
i Rage and Kirby Super Stars on SNES and watching
cheesy disaster movies on ABC
>Iast day there we end up going to this amusement
f t park type place with laser tag, bumper cars, those
V stationary rail ride type deals, etc.
>have the time of my life
>distinotly remember her grabbing my hand during the rail ride
>Iater on, we're sitting on a bench eating ice cream
>she's leaning on me, and tells me she really likes me, and asks me ifl like her back
>being 12 and barely having hit puberty I completely spill my spaghetti and tell her that

Now here's the kicker
>years later, now 26
>my half sister moves down to my area, haven't seen her in years
>decide to go see her and catch up
>decide to bring up the girl, wondering if maybe her family had kept in touch
>turns out none of that happened, it was all an elaborate dream I somehow convinced
myself was real
>had spent the entire time cooped up in the room playing video games by myself and only
came out to eat and there was no such amusement park
I somehow sucked myself in a dream. I am broken. I don't even know how to process this.
