> how do you stop a school shooting?
Take a lesson from bees. When attacked by giant hornets, bees will swarm any hornet that
enters their hive. Stinging does no good because the hornets are armored, but the bees can
survive slightly higher temperatures than the hornets. So they cover the hornet en masse
and vibrate their muscles. The raises the homet's internal temperature until its nervous
system fails. This kills a few bea, but invariably kills the hornet.

> the first few grab onto the shooter's legs and each successive wave latches on a little
higher up his body. climbing the circular pile of their classmates that has formed around the
shooter
> eventually. the shooter is covered with children. immobilized and they make their weird
buzzing noise and begin to shake violently
> the innemtost childrens' internal temperature spikes over 106F and they begin to seize.
further raising their temperature and that of the shooter

cooked alive by a solid ball of small. seizing children
> when it is over. the shooter is left dead in a pile of child corpses
> the rest of the children disperse back to their classrooms and resume their honey making
