>Dad's often away for work,
this time he's been gone for a
little over three weeks
>On my bed watching a show,
little sister comes into my
bedroom and crawls up next
to me despite me asking her
to go away
>Concede and let her watch
my show with me. she keeps
moving and it gets irritating
>She's clutching onto my arm,
a few minutes later she asks
me 'daddy, could you make me
some ice cream'
>I go to the kitchen, ice
cream's just run out
>A few hours later and it's
dinner time, I go back to my
room to bust a nut, maybe
read a little and sleep
>Annoying little thing comes
in my room again and says
'goodnight daddy' and asks
me for a hug
What the fuck is going on.
