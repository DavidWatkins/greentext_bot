wasted my entire memoon waiting for my shithead friend to text me while he was having fun at the bridge with my other
friends. i dont know why he lied about his phone being dead. this isn't the first time he's done something like this. i thought
about it and the last exams before schools out is on thursday and friday and im supposed to be his drive to those, i could
fuck him over and tell him im coming to get him and just not and let him fail manrench. im pretty mad about the whole
thing, since i coulda gotten wet with total 10
What do kl?
