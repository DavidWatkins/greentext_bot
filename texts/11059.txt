I don't want to be alone anymore. It wasn't even
something I was really thinking about until I found this
person, but its honestly soul crushingly painful. I don't
even care about sex or a gf I just don't want to be stuck
in my head. It feels like last year was just yesterday and
its all slipping away: I'm waiting to die alone.
