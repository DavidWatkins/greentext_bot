at fencing and will be going against a 28 master,
Claire's face lit up and yelled out to one of her
friends who came walking in
>she tried to start up another conversation with her
friend trying her best to show Mike that she didn't
want to talk to him anymore
>she's very kind and didn't want to hurt his feelings
for some reason

>looked at me and i tried my best not to look back
into his sleep depriven eyes

much whispering how he thinks Claire's friend is the
hottest girl he's ever seen and wants to "talk" to her
after our conversation

overheard and just starts walking away while
nervously saying goodbye to Claire
