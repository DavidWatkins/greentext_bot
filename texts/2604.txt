of the desert
>Part of a small group of spergs
>Slightly more composed and clever than the
other spergs so Im somewhat of a leader
>Group comprised partially of two mexican kids
who are into the instagram ghetto gang life, but
were too autistic to join a real clique so they hang
around us
>Lets call them Rudy and Tristan
>They are always trying to separate me from the
rest of the autists so we can form a three man
gang
>l always keep turning them down, so eventually
they settle for converting the entire sperg group
, along with me into the gang life
>Rudy and Tristan already wear expensive Nike

>Rudy gives me a pair of his old Nike shoes and
makes me wear them at school at all times
>They draw Nike symbols on the other spergs
shoes so now we all have a sense of uniformity
>One sperg in particular named Nicholas gets
really into it and starts wearing this tacky plastic
gangsta chain he won from a gumball machine
and wears his same stained Eminem T-shirt every
day
>Another autist in our group named Tim uses our
new style as an excuse to start wearing a paper
bag over his head with eye holes punched out
twhich he is constantly being told to remove
because our school has a policy about masksj

UP

>Tristan walks away and I return to my table
>Nicholas noticed that I was having a secret
conversation with Tristan and he wants in on it
>I tell him no but he keeps asking
>Flash forward to today
>Rudy and Tristan never show up to lunch
>Nicholas keeps pestering me about the
conversation
>l feel kind of bad as Nicholas only wants to be
more of a part of this, but at the same time, I know
that it would be too much of a risk to tell him
>As lunch is ending I make a compromise
>l wrote a note on a piece of paper
>I start writing "Bomb-ass weed, 3:00" without
giving away the location or any specific details, but
I still feel that's too incriminating to trust Nicholas
with
>lnstead write "Bomb at 3" trying to be ambiguous
as possible
>I fold up the paper and shake hands with
Nicholas like I saw in this retarded movie in order
to give it to him
>l quietly tell him that he can't open it until I'm
gone and he's nods in autistic excitement
>l get up and hide in the restroom and wait until
the bell rings, anticipating the weed deal that will
go on later today
>Later that day, in Bio class, I have my head down
on the desk when a strange announcement comes
over the loudspeakers
>Apparently the entire school is going to be
evacuated to a "safe area" across town
>0ur entire 2000 student population is herded
outside and slowly loaded onto a revolving cycle of
buses at slow intervals
>As I'm standing outside, people starting
screaming and pointing their phones at something
>There's several fucking police officers on the roof
with rifles walking around
>When I finally get on the bus, I hear rumors that a
note was found in the cafeteria after A lunch,
declaring a bomb threat
>Quickly put two and two together and have an
absolute mental breakdown on the bus

>>47533186 it
>Figure Nicholas wouldn't rat me out, so he must
have accidentally left the note on the table for
some other retard to find
>Bus takes us to a shitty renovated middle school
to wait at so our parents can pick us up
>The moment word gets out that there was a
bomb threat, parents go full blown "muh little
Aiden" and half the town is funnelled into a single
fucking area all at once
>lt starts raining too because it's monsoon season
>Three fucking car accidents
>There are so many people here that the middle
school's parking lot fills up and people have to
park at the adjacent park and youth center
>Every individual kid has to be signed out, so there
is a massive fucking line of parents leading out of
the building and into the rain
>Takes over an hour for my dad to sign me out
>I'm freaking out the whole fucking time
>Students are furious and are talking like they
want to murder the bomber for causing this huge
disruption
What should I do? I don't think I can get charged
with making bomb threats, but if I'm discovered, I
will definitely get expelled. I don't think Nicholas
will tell on me, but he might have shown some of
the other retards the note. I'm so fucking scared
and pissed off. Look this shit up, I'm sure there are
more articles than what I linked.
