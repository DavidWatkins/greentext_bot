>it was like they'd only picked extroverts for this shit
-- mom pushed me into it be she didn't want me in
the house basically
>share a birthday with The most popular guy in my
troop
>only learn it during our lame introductions when
everyone had to say their birthday
>the day comes around and they're surrounded by
friends and get treated like a king
>nobody remembers me
>want to say something but i know they have no
reason to celebrate the weird quiet autist that writes
about nothing during freetime
>get back to our dorms
>not a single call from my mom or anything else but
this pity 'lhappy birthdayl" in my inbox on facebook
it's dumb, but that set the tone for the rest of our trip
there was this girl whose name i shared t kennedy
if you're curious l and it was jarring to see people
call out to her so happily and say good things about
her while nobody had anything to say about me.
and if they did, it was something bad
