We never knew her name, either, or at
least I didn't. Bro went to another college,
so we haven't seen each other since then.
I still give full credit to the guy who
greentexted terrorizing his school bully
with a pineapple, he inspired the idea.
Somewhere out there, that girl can't look
at her pencil pouch without having
flashbacks to the days of having "egg"
yelled near her.
