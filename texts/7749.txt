>'N' has his Chromebook closed and wals over to
'B.'

but I hear it, too.
>"Can I tell you something?" N whispers.
>N is known for being a troublemaker, B and l are
barely holding it together.
>"My Chromebook's fucking dead," he says and
forcefully throws it straight down.
>8 and I lose our shit, teacher looks over from his
desk, but doesn't say anything.
>N gets a cup of water from a cooler we had in the
Classroom.
>Pours it on the Chromebook which is still on the
floor.
