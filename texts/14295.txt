>come to a bend in the street
>see two boys probably around 10 years old
walking ahead of me
>decide to scare the living shit out of them to
alleviate my boredom
>begin quickening my pace
>one of them looks back and says something to
the other
>walk even faster toward them, but control my
pace so that I'm always just coming into view
around each band in the road
>they keep looking back at me with increasingly
concerned faces
>it's working
>Speed up to being on the verge of running, start
making exaggerated arm movements
>they run for their lives
>chase after them still technically walking, their
tiny legs no match for my longboi locomotors
>they disappear around the next corner, I follow
>they've ran to the train station on the other side of
the road and are phoning someone, one of them is
crying
>slow down and look at them as I pass by
>say "Hey, how's it going?" In the friendliest voice I
can
>walk the rest of the way home
