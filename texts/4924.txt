I seriously don't know what to do. I've never
explored my sexuality outside of women. I have
been in a couple of abusive relationships and was
pretty traumatized by one. fl still have nightmares
ffsj Oh, and the best part is l'm currently in a
relationship.
fbf what the fuck should I do? l'm so confused at
this point.
