> when I was in middle school I had
this kid in my class
> his name was Victor
> he always seemed odd to me, but
for the first few years he was mostly
normal
> the weirdest thing he would do would
20,6 kB JPG be screaming at a teacher for no
apparent reason
> but one day it all changed
> he started getting increasingly
aggressive
> he ate a fucking notebook to hide the
fact that he did not have homework
> but his greatest achievement was the
one thing that earned him the title of
"Chairman"
> it was the last year of school
> Victor seemed to have gone
completely mental by now
> one day someone provoked him
during a lesson
> he snapped
> he started crying, stood up, screamed
"I CAN'T CONTROL MYSELF" and threw
a fucking chair at the teacher
> luckily for the teacher his aim was
shit
> mfw this situation was happening
> mfw he had no problems with the
school
> mfw he went on to go to the best
high school in the city and nobody but
our class knows how he once acted
