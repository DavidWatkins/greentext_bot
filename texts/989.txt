I'm just desperate to feel something, I don't know what to
do. I'm so lonely, I didn't even feel this way before I got
my ex...
I really don't care that I sent her my money because I
have a fucking ton... She made me a cute painting. ljust
wanted to hug her more after I hugged her the first time. I
need a real hug from someone :i
