>suddenly I get a brainwave
>i slam my body against my mummys bedroom door,
it flies open and I do a gangsta walk in but I'm quickly
winded, my cleanest cargo shorts pulled to my knees,
my Hannah Montana night shirt tucked into my undies,
and my best MAGA cap worn backwards and tilted
on my head fsomething I kissed it for beforehand as
a preemptive apologyl
>"ay baby wassup, it's yo boy Tendie Fresh in
da houuuuse"
>ever since thatjungle noise they call fcyrap music has
become popular again after years of being rightfully hated
by any civilized member of society, I decided tojoin the
fad and become a rapper too
>she sighs "anon please go back to sleep. It's 3 AM and I
have to get ready for work in a few hours"
>"ay ay ay hoe, don't diss me, I'm here to give yo ass a
concert," I feel like I'm doing very well at emulating a black
person despite not having any experience being around
one, "I call dis single 'Poopoo in da streetz,' I wrote it while
I was in a very dark place"
>she massages her temples and sighs again
>i give her the best performance ever, it's a masterpiece
of dancing, lyrics, and vocal music. I feel like it's worth
a hefty reward of GBP
>I'm breathing heavily but I'm asking forthe
reward anyway
>she laughs, "you don'tjust walk in here, scream about
hating the Jews between loud 'dun duns' that you make
with your mouth and ask for points reserved for when
you do something good."
>that whorebag is sitting there mocking mel Mel
Her special little angell
>i almost want to run back to my room crying and
poopooing my pants out of embarrassment, but I
decide to do what all black people do when their
mummys disrespect them
>i slapped her hard and she collapsed against the bed
>I take her hand and I write a 50,000 GBP coupon
in her name with it
>I quickly waddle back to my room with it,
farting frantically
>me I get more tendies and am super hip
