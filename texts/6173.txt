>Know this one girl I go to camp with,
probably one of my only friends at that
camp and have a crush on her
>One day she is acting really depressed
and self- conscious, saying she thinks she
is ugly
>Looking back on it, she was probablyjust
fishing for compliments, but I fell for the bait
and tried to make her feel better
>Try to tell her that she isn't ugly
>What l was going to say was "Cheer up,
you're not ugly"
>Thanks to my crippling autism, what I
ACTUALLY said was "Cheer up, you're not
THAT ugly"
