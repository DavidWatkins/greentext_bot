>mommy tells me she's going to take me to see
Force Awakens a while back
>She tells me to get into the car and warm it up
as she puts her makeup on
>too big for the front so I waddle to the car and
get in the middle back seat so I don't put too
much weight on one side
>aII of a sudden a guy runs up our driveway and
takes mommy's car
>too distracted to notice me sitting in the
backseat
>as he began to flee, I slouched in my seat
deeper than ever before
>after 5 minutes, just enough time for him to
feel safe, I spoke up in the monotone of a person
who didn't understand the gravity of the situation
>"I am in the backseat, AMA"
>He was shocked and terrified by my non-
nonchalance, causing him to lose control of
Mommy's car and crash into a nearby Denny's.
>He was dead upon impact but I emerged
without a scratch because I didn't tense up
>As I stepped out of the flaming wreckage, my
strong legs glistening with sweat from the heat
of victory and waifu pillow in hand, applause
erupted throughout the establishment
>"Hero" they called me, a title I reluctantly
accepted
>Unaffected by the commotion, I calmly
walkedover to a booth and beckoned a beautiful
Denny's waitress
>"No need for a menu" I said, "I'll be having 2 of
everything"
>for the first time in my life, I ate at a restaurant
without my Mom.
