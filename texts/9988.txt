>th a girl you know who you haven't seen in
a long time, but you've been fapping to her
sexy social media pictures constantly, you
suddenly see again, and you're shocked by
how much you like her as a person, and you
feel bad for the horribly disgusting and
degrading thoughts you've had about her
It's so embarrassing to say, but I forgot she
was human. I feel horrible now.
