>>Guy I know is roommates with another guy that
we don't really like, but still hang around with for
some reason.
>>Guy is moving out soon, so we decide to prank
roommate while he is out one day.
>>Gonna put blue koolaid in his shampoo, turn him
into a smurf.
>>We do the deed, notice his computer is still on in
his room. We've had suspicions of his odd porn
obsessions for a while. tOnce found a folder of gay
porn downloading, he tried to blow it ofO.
>>Start finding all kinds of weird porn. Simpcest,
Sonic the hedgehog, etc. There were also
photoshops of people he knew onto nude models.
Then there was the CP. Kids as young as toddlers.
>>Take his hard drive, drive to police station. Later
that day he starts messaging us freaking out
because he noticed the drive missing. He didn't say
that was the reason, just that he was panicking.
>>My buddy god audio recording of him freaking
out while showering because of the blue, buddy
nope'd out of there so he wouldn't be assaulted by
smurf.
>>He probably was blue when he was arrested.
>>Saw his court dates later. Was supposed to give
testimony but he plead guilty.
