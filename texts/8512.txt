- in your comfy isolated
tower, studying arcane

>You will never have a cute
familiar that gathers potion ingredients for
you and keeps you company
>You will never take on a curious
apprentice who seeks your esoteric
wisdom and goes on adventures with you
>You will never terrorize the filthy normies
of the village near your tower with grand
displays of power
>You will never fight off attempts on your
treasured mystical tomes
>You will never watch the sunset from your
study's balcony, waiting for the night to fall
so you can observe the heavens
>You will never convene with your fellow
wizards, reminiscing on the days when
magic was young and the world free of the
taint of normies
Why do we live?
