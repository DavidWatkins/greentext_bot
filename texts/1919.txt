>Her eyes so blue
>I knew just what she wanted to do
>Her skin so soft
>Her legs so fine
>l ran my fingers
>l30wn her spine
>I didn't know how but I tried my best
>T0 place my hand on her breasts
>I remember my fear
>lVly fast beating heart
>But slowly she spread her legs apart
>And when she did it I felt no shame
>All at once
>The white stuff came
>At last it's finished
>lt's all over now
>lVly first time milking a cowl
