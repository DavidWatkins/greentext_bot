>to be fair, he was trying to make light of whats going on,
laughing and asking him politely to let go
>Joker immediately loses interest and lets go, but
accidentally tugs on the guys leg. He knows what he's done,
as does stilts. His fate has been sealed.
>stilts starts leaning more and more to the left until he goes
down and wipes out 3 girls posing for a photo, glasses
breaking, drinks spilled everywhere.
>by this point, Joker has blended into the crowd and is now
dancing on his own with a pair of sun glasses that he didn't
have before
>l leave the girl and go and get Joker, telling him to stop
fucking around, he just laughs hysterically, drinks his
beverage and waddles back into the crowd
>i already knew this night will not end well.
>lt's around 1:30, stilts guy is back up although he now
smells of chocolate tequila and bleach, the girls are sitting
in a corner trying to cover the dirt on their asses from falling
on the floor.
>but Joker is not finished yet
>I realize that everytime I leave him, the skid mark does
something else. But I really gotta take a piss.

>leave him for about 10 minutes and come back and go
hunting for him.
>Joker is a slippery fucker to catch, I decided to walk
around the people dancing, hoping to find him. I eventually
do, he's sitting down with about 10 different drinks taking a
sip of each one before swallowing.
>l ask him about it and he just looks at me and tells me that
people are leaving their drinks, so he took them as well, he
also took someone's phone.
>wewfuckinglad.jpeg
>i told him to finish the drinks and we'll be going soon.
>We go outside to the smoking area for the last time and
notice that it's empty except for some hipster guy and his
landwhale gf as well as some bar staffs dressed in clown
outfits.
>We're at the back of the area having a smoke and I notice
joker is playing about with his new phone, he starts fucking
with the contacts and accidentally rings one.
>There aren't many people, but the sound of Wonderwall
can be heard, I look to the hipster couple and see the ear
gauged cunt reach into his denim coat and pull out his
phone and answered it.
>Joker notices this as well and just looks at him and puts
the phone to his mouth and whispers something offensive
about the guy's gf
>hipster gets visibly upset and looks around and see's
joker on the phone and nudges his fudge girl and her eyes
opened
>OHSHIT.jpg

FUCKING PHONE BACK"

>Joker looks at me and giggles and begins running towards
the exit thinking he can get passed the bar staff who are
taking out the trash.
>One of the bar staff see's all the commotion and knocks
joker flat on his ass, but joker ain't out of the fight yet..
>Bar staff begin to form around Joker, so they could make
him exit the premises, bouncers haven't arrived yet.
>Joker begins freaking out and clocks the guy grabbing
him, right in the jaw
>clown falls flat
>Joker is screaming like a fucking monkey, the fat bitch is
doing a mating call, the bar man is out cold
>Joker manages to get free and stampedes out of the
smoking area. I'm on his tail
>We get out of the emergency exit and see that there are
more fucking clowns coming for us and there are some in
front of us putting garbage into the bins out back.
>As we are making our way past them, the dude who Joker
hit rams into the back of him and pushes Joker up against
the wall and they both begin to fight it out.
>Joker can fight, but it's slowly turning in the dudes favor
so I try to break it up and we're both about to go our
separate ways when all I see is Joker hit the dude when I'm
pushing them away.
>They both get into it again and i'm sandwiched between
them.
>clowns to the left of me
