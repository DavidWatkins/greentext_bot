She cried and told me the truth
My mom left my dad and the country she
abandoned me
My dad would knew that would crush me and lied
instead
He never told anything and kept working for my
sake
She told me he was crying when i spent time in my
mom fake grave
Fuck guys i don't know anymore
Are we here just to suffer all my life is a lie and
nobody cares about me anymore
