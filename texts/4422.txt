I, like you, thought crying was very therapeutical, so I pushed it a bit like you are doing.
>started to write about my life while listening to very sad songs
> started crying
> continued listening to the same sad album and crying and writing for 3 straight days
> suddenly get sick
> start coughing without a reason
> cough for 5 hours at night every single night for like 4 months
> spend daytime like a zombie due lack of sleep
> every night start coughing again
> going insane due lack of sleep
> thought 1 was gonna die
> so bad I even thought about making last will
> went to all doctors. no one could help
> keep coughing at nights all night long. no sleep
> destroy all the writings in hope maybe this all psychological
> erase album
> still sick
> eat only rice and drink only water in the hope is some food related thing
> doesn't go away
> wear 3M big air mask like a psycho in the hope it has something with the air
> doesn't go away
> thisismylifenowjpg
> tinally find ultra expensive doctor
> spend a fucking fortune
> doc calls me down
> finally the thing stops
> can't believe my tirst night of sleep
Never again I'm gonna push the crying even a tiny bit Anon, I can tell you that.
