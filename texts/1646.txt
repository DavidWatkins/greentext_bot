Copy-pasting my story from a different
thread
>10th grade, finally get back to public school
>Annual bomb drill in the first 2 weeks of
school
>1,000 t students shuffle onto the field
>There's an overturned trashcan just sitting
there in the middle of a massive crowd of
students
>An overturned trash can
>During a regularly scheduled bomb drill
>That happens on the same day every year
>At the same place every year
>l go up to an administrator, get his
attention, and just point at the trash can
>Dumbass just stares at it for like 10
seconds silently
>Goes up to it and kicks it over
>Nothing was under there but what the
actual fuck, that would have been the
absolute easiest way to slaughter hundreds
of students
>Junior and Senior year bomb drills l
convince my teachers to go out to the
parking lot instead because our
administration is incompetent
