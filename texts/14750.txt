22, good looking, often get complimented, flt, IQ in the
1205, in uni, yet still a useless sack of shit and suicidal
thoughts are a daily occurrence.
I legitimately wish I died. But I don't want to kms because
then everyone'd know what a loser I am, and that's my
greatest fear. I want a car to smash into me or maybe I
could sacrifice myself to save someone in a shoplift,
taking a bullet. That'd be swell, I'd die a hero.
How you doing?
