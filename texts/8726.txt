If you have never had the displeasure of smelling this
stuff, imagine leaving a cooked egg and a massive wet
shit in a jar for a good week and then opening it to take
a wiff. It's horrible

You have to be really cautious with this stuff. One mispray will leave your

I'm surprised you don't have to be 18 to buy it, that's how powerful it is.
