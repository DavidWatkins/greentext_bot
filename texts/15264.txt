it was the best hug ever man, wejust met
each other and it all went fine, going out
and relaxing is great. I'm not that retard
to start thinking about her all the time, but
damn I'm happy as hell because we are now
friendsl
i will now get in the best shape of my life
because I think there's hope for future
movies together and I don't want to feel
ashamed of my body and I don't want her to
feel embarrassed about being seen with an
overweight guy.
