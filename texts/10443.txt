>get up to 2pl8 bench
Eventually I got complacent and here I am
doing nothing with all my free time and
living as a filthy NEET.
It still hurts but that's because I'm a faggot
pussy living in the past. Haven't gotten a
girlfriend since and have basically
renounced women entirely.
How do i rebuild my motivation, fitbros?
How do I stop living in the past? I want to
reclaim my birthright. Post advice and
motivation, please save my defeatist soul.
