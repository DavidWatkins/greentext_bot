Ok what the hell. Did that fucking insect follow me
and make residence inside my shoe? Keep in mind
my house is big and my room is UPSTAIRS. Of all
the fucking places it could've been, it was inside my
fucking shoe. I know it's the same one because it
was half-dead when I found it. Same colorlsize too.
Why would it follow me? This isn't the first time this
has happened either. I swear everytlme I see a
roach downstairs in my kitchen, a few hours later it
somehow ends up being in my fucking room. I don't
get it.
