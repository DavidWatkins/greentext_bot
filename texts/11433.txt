pointing game, in the game someone makes a
claim and everyone points to the person they
think is most likely to do it

> Her friends all act super serious too
> Realise she actually looks pretty boyish
> At this point I'm generally uncertain of if she
has had a sex change or not
> Being high and autistic I come to the
conclusion that they weren't kidding
> Later me and one of my sperg friends are in
the bathroom talking
> I tell him that one of the girls has had a sex
change
> He thinks I'm kidding, convince him I'm serious
> He starts freaking out, says that he has to ask
her later to just make sure
> I tell him "Ok, but what ever you do don't
mention my name"
Later we are all sitting in a group inside, he
walks up to girl and asks her:
> Are you a tranny?
> The look on her face is priceless
> lsthisguyforrealgif
> She says she isn't, and asks why he would
ask her that.

> I explain that when we were playing the game
they acted super serious and I didn't understand
if they meant it or not
>MFW none of my friends remember it
> MFW girls end up leaving 2 minutes later
> MFW the guy who asked her wasn't even high
