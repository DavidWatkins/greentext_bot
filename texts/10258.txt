As he stared into his phone screen Kyle came
up with the perfect caption for his Reddit post
"Anon loses his image" he typed, before posting
the screenshot that came from some stranger on
4chan.org. But Kyle didn't care where or who it was
from, all he cared about were those 241 upvotes he
would be receiving on rfgreentext by the end of that
afternoon. It wasn't much, but for Kyle...that was
enough to avoid throwing his head through the rope
he had prepared, hanging from a hook on the roof
of his miniscule apartment. "Not today old friend"
he says as he lies in his bed drifting into sleep. Just
another day in the life of a redditor.
