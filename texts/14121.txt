along, singing his faking
150 KB JPG song, upon the forest trail.
>When a sudden screech,
and a wing flap, raised the Fakenators
attention from the map.
>There in front she lights, in all her glorious
might.
>Her eyes great pools of wonder.
>She turned with a wail, and lifted her tail,
to reveal her cloaca down under.
>My hands lost their hold, but they were
not old, just simply focused on my belt.
>I approached her quite calm, and she
sprawled on the lawn, her underbelly softer
than a rabbit's pelt.
>With a somple push, my member slid in,
and she nearly gushed.
>I started slow, listening to her crow, not
wanting to rush.
>Soon my pace was quite good, and she
understood, her claws sunk into my jeans.
> I lifted her up, layed her upon my buff,
amd she rode me while on me she lean.
