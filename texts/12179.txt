I won't tell you what I said to the him to get him to
come down from there, that'll stay between me
and him forever. But I'll never forget what he said
to me ten years later after he'd gotten through
therapy, graduated top of his class and gotten
engaged:
"That day on the roof of the school, anon, I could
never have come down if i hadn't've read the first
letter of each line"
