For shame ir9ki sure blind people need more assistance than most other typically sensory Impaired
people, but they appreciate and love you for it all the more,
> tfw when I'm by myself no girl pays attention to me.
> when l'm walking my little sister around town, girls won't stop 000an at how I am with her,
> tiw a bookshop girl was miring how patient I was getting all the braille books down for her to read the titles
and started asking if I was single and my little sister got mad, grabbed my hand, whipped her cane out and
lead me out of the shop
> "She wouldn't be good for you anon, she sounded like a parasite and her voice was shrill"
> ttw hearing that tapping noise on my bedroom door i1 live in the BIND at 2 in the morning because she has
a headache and can't hnd the ibuprofen box
> ttw she gets lonely and decides to hold the back of my shirtlmy shoulder as I go around the house and
then gets mad when I tell her to wait in the livingroom because I have to go to the bathroom.
> tfw her batrsenses can hear you masturbate at night in spite of playing music over it and she teases you
relentlessly for it the next day when nobody is around.
> tfw she can smell when it's about to rain
Before you point out the obvious I know our deal is unhealthy but I had to watch her lose her sight one day
at a time and it tears me up that someone as great as her can't experience life and see the wonders of the
planet to the fullest like some crack whore party girl can,
