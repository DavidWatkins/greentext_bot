>day starts off great
>birds are chirping sun is shining
>cl0uds are far and few in the blue sky
>riding bike around the block
>all the houses reminiscent of each other
>traveling through maze of green lawns and happy folk
>greeting your fellow neighbors
>other kids see your inadvertent call to action
>they get on their bikes and follow
>peddling in tandem
>you accidentally hit a rock and glide a few feet from your bike
>as you hit the asphalt you hear the bike chains Clank to a halt
>when you open your eyes a blurry figure appears over you
>it has long flowing hair, its true nature obscured by the sun behind it
>blink a few more times
>it's revealed to be sally, your crush
>she must've heard the commotion outside when you passed by her house
>shes smiling and asks if you're alright
>you nod yes in reply
>shes sitting still staring into your eyes
>is this it, you ask? 'is this my moment?
>but the birds lay silent
>you look around and the other kids are standing like statues
>looking back at sally you feel cold liquid drip onto your face
>her skin is melting like wax
>shes oozing onto you
>her clothes sliding off onto the pavement
>you scream out of horror getting up
>the other kids start melting
>as you run around owing and screaming the world around you begins to melt
>you begin melting too
>feel as your body breaks apart
>fall to your stubble knees, your body forming into a gelatinous ooze
>OOZE OOZE OOZE OOZE
