>working with 3 Stacy manager, doing all her work as
well as my own because im too much of a spineless
faggot to tell her i dont like it
>that cunt doesn't even give a fuck, everything she does
is browsing shitty normie memes on instagram and loudly
talking on the phone to her other Stacy friends about
some girly shit or that one guy she rejected yesterday
>our office isn't very modern and the chair im sitting on is
old and broken
>kinda uncomfortable to sit on it and makes my back go
numb sometimes
>i keep asking the manager cunt to get me a new chair
but she always tells me yeah yeah sure don't worry
>never ends up actually doing anything about it I
>usually come home exhausted after doing work for 2
people while sitting on a shitty chair
>i have a weird thing that if I'm tired it's hard for me to fall
asleep
>Iaying in my bed deprived of sleep because of all this
makes me think about my miserable existence and
rethink my life choices
>also thinking about my manager a lot, what a shitty
person she is and how I'm grateful that despite being a
lowly being I'm at least not like her
>yesterday i was at work again and my back went numb
as always
>i started complaining about the chair to Stacy cunt and
she jokingly said aw come on chairs are expensive but a
back rub is free
>spaghetti all over the floor .jpg
>she giggles and proceeds to rub my back but it's so
numb I don't feel anything
>this whole situation and my hate towards my manager
and general anxiety around females made me go full
autism mode so I decided to finally tell her all I think
>so I turned around and said
I've become so numb
I can't feel you there
I've become so tired
So much more aware
I'm becoming this
All I want to do
Is be more like me
And be less like you
