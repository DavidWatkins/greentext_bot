Tomorrow will be my two week anniversary. A group of coworkers
invited me out to a sports bar for wings last weekend. Those
were the first new numbers I saved in my phone in years. It's
actually nice having a little money coming in and somewhere l'm
expected to be everyday. It's like I matter to the world again.
