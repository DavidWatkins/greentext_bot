That was about six years ago. if it happened today,
a girl like her could probably pull together enough
asshole women to pressure conventions into
disinviting him, get websites to take his content
down, etc. It was bizarre. He couldn't even
remember why he had friended her. He assumed
he had talked to her at a convention somewhere
along the line.
