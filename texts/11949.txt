>Be me
>Work at subway
>yesterday I had a chick come in, she told
me she wanted a Veggie Delight. As I
went to get the bread she asked me if I
could change my gloves cause she was
vegan and I had been handling meat. I did
that, no problem, perfectly reasonable
request. I get her bread, toast it and put
all the veggies she wants on it, I start to
wrap up her sandwich when she says,
"can I get some mayo?"
>Wut.wav
>I look at her, she's looking at me, I pick
up the mayo, I'm waiting for her to be like
haha jk.
>Nothing.
>Me: "You know mayonnaise has eggs in
it right?"
>THIS. GIRL. JUST. STOOD. THERE.
SILENT.
>Vegan.exe has stopped responding
>She stood there for a second.
>V: "N-no it doesn't, I get mayo every
time, are you sure?"
>Me: "Yes ma'am, mayo has egg whites
in it."
>I felt so horrible, she stood there with
such a distraught and defeated face, I
had shattered this poor girl's world.
>I had a couple people waiting so I had to
get this lady out of here.
>Me: "Would you like the mayo on it
ma'am?"
>V: "Sure, go ahead."
>My life is a lie.wav
>80 I gave her her mayo, wrapped her
sandwich up and charged her for her
sandwich, she was silent the whole time.
She took her sandwich and started
walking out.
>Me: "Thank you for coming, have a nice
dayl"
>She just looked at me, sighed, "yea, I'll
try" and walked out.
>And that's the story of how I taught a
vegan that mayonnaise is, in fact, not
vegan.
