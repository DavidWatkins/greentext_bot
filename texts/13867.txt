>Do mainly sandwiches and salads
>Same few sorority girls come in day after
day
>Never tip, always have custom orders
>Watch them bully some young pledge of
theirs in the dining area one time and
decide to act
>l start making their portions slightly larger:
a little more bacon in the breakfast
sandwich here, an extra portion of egg on
the cobb salad there
>Spiking the sugary syrup in their fountain
sodas higher
>Watch them slowly gain weight over the
course of three months, how their orders
continue to grow in size and expense
>I have nothing but time
>And they're always hungry for more now
