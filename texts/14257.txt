>ln 6th grade
>l was a band kid who borrowed my
instrument because my parents couldn't pay
for it, and I had to return the instrument every
day in a storage container behind the school
>One day one of the popular band girls
corners me in the container and says 'Why
are you such a freak"
>lt was so sudden and strange, this girl
alwaysjust acted like I didn't exist
>Even back then my hatred for these status
obsessed 'cool girls' was really high
>l couldn't even respond, ljust sort of
snarled at her like my clogs do
It was gratifying seeing her eyes go wide and
watching her skitter away but her clique
made it a point to shit on me after that
