Oh geez, yeah thankfully the stuff never lasted long. I
have another story about friend e2
>Be along the river bank in the woods
>5 min walk from a local park
>Be in a group of 8 people
>Friend 1 was my best bro, call him Bro
>Bro asks if anyone has that spice stuff
>Some madlad with us actually did
>He had what looked like an 8th of it
>l turn it down and say not to use my bowl for it, kid has
his
>Bro and kid smoke a massive bowl ofJUST SPICE
>Bro starts freaking out
>Pointing at the river
>Bro starts freaking out that the British are coming
>Runs towards the park full of kids and people shouting
"THE BRITISH ARE COMING"
>Others finish up and try to catch up to him
>A guy named "J" and I run after him right away, I
handed my bowl to another good friend there
>Catch Bro as he's on the edge of the park
>people staring and whispering about him
>he looks sick and is sweating and feels cold
>he looks at me and whispers he's scared
"I know bro you're gonna be okay let's go just walk nice
and calmly and just focus on breathing in your nose out
your mouth"
>He fucking holds my hand and we walk away
>Can feel him shaking
>J lives literally half a block from this park
>We go to J's house and make sure nobody saw us go in
there from the park so if they called the cops they can't
follow us
>Bro calms down after about 45 minutes of being there
>Threw up a bit too, get him water
>Him and l dip and on the walk back to his house get us
some food and he eats it and passes out
>was sick forthe next day, didn't go to school
Poor bro. We learned to never fuck with the stuff again.
