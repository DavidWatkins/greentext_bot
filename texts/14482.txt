>th Stacy worked hard at school and
L5 doubled up with college classes, took
f care of her siblings at home neglected by
V her parents, worked a part time job to
64 KB PNG help support them. Gave you her notes
when you're depressed and skip school,
helped you when you have questions, made sure your
voice was heard in group discussions, tried to include you
at lunch or with her friends or study groups but you're too
autistic and different to accept the invitation.
I'm sorry.

Can this meme end please? Chad was never nice, it's just
halo effect. Chad has always been a hypocrite. He is the
king and you're the peasant, never forget that.
