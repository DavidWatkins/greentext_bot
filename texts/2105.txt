>Tonight there is an orchestra
10 KB JPG playing in my town to pay tribute
to the old town hall that was going to be
demolished
>About time, rats and mice infested the place
>Walking outside the venue, I see a bunch of
people acting like puppets, making fun of the
politicians
>Get distracted
>Trip over stick on the ground
>Land face first into a pie
>As I stand up rats start to gather around me
trying to get a taste of the pie
>Walk inside anyways, rats trailing behind me
>People already there are overcome with emotion
and move to the music
>Mfw just like the pied piper
>Led rats through the streets
>Dance like marionettes
>Swaying to the symphony
>Of destruction
