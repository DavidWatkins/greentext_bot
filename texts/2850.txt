>mom finally pushes me to get
drivers license, takes me 4 tries to
78 KB PNG pass test but did three months ago.
She buys me a used older car,
although I rarely drive it since I don't go outside
much.

she didn't feel like going.
>drop massive amounts of spaghetti but manage.
>on my way home, turning right at a red light,
looking for cars coming so I can turn.
>see break and start out without realizing that two
pedestrians were starting to cross, a man and a
woman. tthey had the walk sign so this was 100Wo
my faultl
>Stop when I hear them screaming at me, man
threatening to kill me. Both looked okay but I don't
know for certain.
>l crack a window try to say I'm sorry and to ask if
anyone was hurt but the only thing he did was
threaten me, and starting kicking the side of the
car. 010 dents to prove this thought I'm almost
certain she snapped a picture of metmy plate with
her phone.
>l gunned it and drove off. No phone my otherwise
I'd have called the cops and let them sort it out.
>drove home shaking like a leaf, now mom is
screaming at me herself because I forgot
something at the store. I haven't told her what
happened.
>now waiting for police to show up, what are the
chances of this and what am I looking at if I do get
arrested?
