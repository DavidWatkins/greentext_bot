>Did you finish searching the suspect's computer?
>We did...and we found something. There was a folder on
the desktop labeled Fitness.
>Fitness? Thats not exactly cause for concern.
>Thats just it, sir. We think it might be some kind of code.
It was labeled fitness but inside we only found text files of
incest stories and pictures titled "Brap."
>Hmmm. It might be some kind of stenography. We'd
better contact the Feds and let them handle this. We might
be on to something big here.
