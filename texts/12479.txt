>decide to finally make a FB
account
>"gonna reconnect with some
79 KB JPG friends and have something to
finally add my fellow wageslavers on haha, it's
gonna be great"
>start adding people, have to take a break
because of the social anxiety l'm about to put
myself through, feels like l'm bothering them with a
request because l'm such a loser
>took a selfie for profile picture, took days of
deciding on a good one
>start messaging people and making small talk,
progress, I think
>wake up yesterday to all my friends I added
suddenly gone, deleted, like I never even added
them
>wtf make a bug report, it's been two days now,
profile dormant, people probably wondering if l'm
having some kind mental break down but it wasn't
me that deleted them all
>too scared to re-add them all and having to
explain what happened, especially former
classmates, that was hard enough to do anyway
feeling like a pest
I gave it a go, I got the fucking Z U C C and I
should have seen it coming. It was like the
universe knew I shouldn't have even tried.
