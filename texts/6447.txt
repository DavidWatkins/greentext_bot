>Waiting for my store to open one
day cute girl comes and stands by me

with some random grill

fuck up
>Say our goodbyes as we both have to get to work
>Somehow managed to be normal enough to not
scare her off seeing her a couple more times
>Eventually gets to the point of hugs and even
hand holding
>Find out thanks to mutual friends of mural friends
that she actually likes me
>Gets to the point where I miss a very obvious clue
she wants to kiss
>Not seen her since
>Store where I work that I actually get to see her is
closing and I'm getting transferred to a different one
