First step of fixing your life is to stop blaming others, and
taking a good look at yourself. I'm glad another anon has
noticed this.
And to any anons that have trouble doing self reflecting I
suggest any of the following basic self thought,
meditation, drugs such as Isd, shrooms, or weedle
deedie. Think of what's bothering you and then figure
your out why and then go down the rabbit hole, but focus
more of how you could be the issue.
