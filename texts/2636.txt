This was almost four years ago, and I've been
paranoid ever since. Every time I hear a police
siren, I turn off my lights, and look through my
blinds. I've skipped both that rail line and part of
town since. I even quit school, just in case. And
still, the anxiety drives me so fucking insane, it
feels like a constant battle of having to stave off
panic attacks. Seriously, I always feel like l
screaming.
