because three of the people she's
sitting next to are spics themselvesi

legal resident

because she assumed he came into the country
illegally
>spic tells her that he's a legal resident, just a non
citizen
>pasty girl condescendingly questions why he
hasn't obtained citizenship if he's been in the
country the whole time
>other spic gets riled up and says "well you do
know the white people came here illegally too"
>all of them start teaming up against her. talks
about how some of their family members are illegal
>one spic talks about her aunt being an illegal who
hasnt applied for citizenship and never will because
she hates the country and only came here to
provide opportunities for her kids
>another spic tells a similar story
>a self hating white agrees with what the spics are
saying for conformity
