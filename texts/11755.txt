There's no problem with attraction, she's a 7l8 and
I'm about a 5 so the 'relationship' is already fragile
enough and I'm lucky to have got to this stage.
I'm broken about this and spent the journey back to
my place utterly depressed, this is the worst I have
felt in a very long time. Any advice robots?
