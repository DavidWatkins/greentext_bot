>he sissy trap anon on ls4sJ
>you already went through all the stages of
prison gay: futa, traps, yaoi, regular gay
porn
>now you just want someone to cuddle
with because you're a lonely neet
>one night you chat up on discord with
some cute ljpl boy
>in the heat of the moment, you
accidentally let out your deepest sexual
fantasies, you wanna be someone's
submissive live-in maid bf
>he really enjoys the idea of being your
"goshujin-sama" and agrees to buy you a
properly titted maid outfit so you can be his
live-in maid girl lmalel
>weeks later, you arrive at his house,
you're kinda nervous
>but you shouldn't be, after all. you two did
spend long nights doing ERP and trading
lewd pics and fapping on cam
>you should be fine. he's the same guy
offline as he is online
>he lulls you into a false sense of security
and belonging, his familiar voice puts you
at ease
>the oolong tea he made is 800 good,
simply cuddling with your head on his lap is
soothing for the soul
>you notice you forgot how long you've
been sitting like this, you notice it gets
harder to form coherent thoughts and it
gets hard to move at all
>he laced the tea with something and you
struggle to stay awake, but it's no use
>you wake up, chained up in a basement
with your arms tied behind your back. your
head still hurts and your thoughts are still
cloudy
>your hair is kinda damp, he must have
bathed you and dressed you in the maid
outfit while you were unconscious
