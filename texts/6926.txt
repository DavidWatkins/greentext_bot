This kid is fucking dumber than potato
soup. Herets a joke he came up with the
other day:
> knock knock
, > whois there?
> oh no
> oh no who?
Proceeds do burst into laughter.
Seriously wtf? Another time we caught him
writing on his towel with permanent marker.
When we asked him why, he said that its
so he remembers which side to use. Like
he thought towels were one sided. The kid
often forgets that hes eating at dinner and
will just stare at the ceiling, he barks at
random ass dogs and is just dumb in
general. For example, just the other night:
> okay jstep broj, which of these rhyme:
cat, apples, hat?
> tuhhh, all of them?
I want him to be tested so we get money to
get him help but no apparently he doesnt
need it. I know that he's still only 10yrs old
but wtf. Another time he decided that
instead of taking his dirty socks off, he
would just put another sock on each foot.
Can anyone else relate?
