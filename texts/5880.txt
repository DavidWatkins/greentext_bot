don't even know their lines and lead into abrupt awkward
moments

>"Hello everyone, I hope you've enjoyed this fantastic
play so far. Before we begin, would anyone give us a
suggestion for a Frozen rendition?"

>"Yes Anon?'i
>"l'd like to suggest a video called i'Let it go Ukulele

>everyone near him falls silent
>a vicious and devious grin curls upon fellow bros lips,
as they begin evilly cackling and wringing their hands
