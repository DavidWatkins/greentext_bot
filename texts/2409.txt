>l think the worst has to be when you tried to
improve then you failed badly and then those piece
of shits say 'lt's just one failure bro you need to
gain experience' even though you've tried
countless times before and then they pressure you
into asking out a girl who rips apart your soul with a
disgusted look then they all laugh about and
months later when the last time they saw you was
3 months ago and they never checked up all those
times they send you one text asking where you've
been which you ignore and that's the last time you
bothered to get friends again
I hope someone sodomises them with AK-47's
