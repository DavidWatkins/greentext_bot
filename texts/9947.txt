up to a breathing machine
>have to sheepishly tell the doctors that he inhaled a
bunch of alcohol through a bong on accident
>it was a honey comb bong so you know how close the
bubbles can get to your mouth
>after a few hours hes asleep and on a breathing machine
>doctors tell me that his lungs started to spasm and
wouldn't inhale afterthe alcohol vapor coated his lungs
>tells me if I hadnt inflated his lungs he would be a dead
man
>friends gets chemical burns in his lungs

>smoke a blunt as soon as he gets out
And that's how i almost killed my friends and ultimately
saved him.
And now when he tell the story he makes me out to be an
asshole even though I saved him.
Bong was squeaky clean though.
