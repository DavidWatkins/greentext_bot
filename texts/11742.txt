I feel like I got a parasite in me. What the fuck
should I do guys? Her mother and her are
extremely close and she literally has no where else
to go except to sleep in her car. I don't want for my
gf to have to see her mother be that way. But she's
been here so long and it's my fucking house, plus
she's a stuck up opinionated cunt.
