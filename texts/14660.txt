a year or so ago
>was a jerk to her constantly
>called her out on IG filters, uptalk and other
signs of insecurity
>on time I said I think she's real pretty
>she brings this up later, saying that she
feels I like her
>I responded: "I don't like you, I like the way you look"
>eventually she doesn't talk to me anymore
>back to the message today
>asks me why I was always such a fucking jerk
>tell her the truth, that l was insecure, that I was
angry at the world, and that she looked like an
easy target at the time
>we talk a bit more, I apologize, she shows me
exactly what I said to her back then
>at one point in the conversation, tell her that it's up
to her to message me, if she ever wants to talk again
>do this without romantic intent
>she says, "You seem like a nice person, but
you're too nice for me"
>mfw
>says she was hoping I was still a jerk and that she
wanted to mess around with someone
>tell her I'm not interested in that
>turns out the girl I bullied a year ago came back
because she wanted to fuck
I hate judging people, but, man.
