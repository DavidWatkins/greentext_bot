> Now, I'm sure many of you have encountered little shits in
supermarkets.
> Little kids running about and knocking things over, being
rude, walking all over their parents, you know the kind.
> But the worst are the biters. Yes, those little cunts that feel
it is okay to bite you whenever they feel like it.
> Okay, here's the best part. A biter got me today when l was
grocery stopping. He broke the fucking skin, too.
> This was when the gears started turning.
> The moment I saw a tiny sprickle of blood on the little shit's
teeth as he was grinning at me like the little cunt he is.
> I made my eyes get wide, and started screaming "SHlTl
SHITI."
> Now, my good friend, Tom we'll call him, was there too, and
he instantly picked up on it.
> He started shouting "FUCKI MAYBE HE DIDN'T GET ITI
FUCKI."
> By now, the kid is scared shitless and starts crying.
> Mizz Mom appears out of nowhere and starts getting pissy
at us for yelling at her kid.
> Here's the kicker, I look her straight in the eye and say
> "Mam, get your son tested as soon as possible, hejust hit
me and I'm... I'm FUCKING HIV POSITIVE."
> And now there is silence. Not a peep in the entire store.
> The brat knows hejust fucked up big time because his
mom isn't defending his ass.
> She just stares at me wide eyed.
> I walk away from them, buy my shit from the wide eyed
cashier
> All the while blood is dripping from my calf, making a nice
little trail on the floor.
> And, just as we leave, we start to hear the mother sobbing.
Sobbing like the cunt she is.
> I have never felt any more satisfaction than the moment I
heard that sob.
