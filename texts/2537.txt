50 KB JPG since kindergarten
>Never really spoken
>She's a bit heavy, and she's incredibly shy
>She rarely talks among her group of friends
>Her "friends" are total bitches who keep her and a less-
thanvgood-Iooking girl around to make themselves feel
better about the fact that they'd be 8s or 9s were it not for
incredibly minor things they can't help
>She's rarely without her group though
>I think she's afraid of her "friends" ditching her
>lf l, a 6'3" 290lb. brute, was to walk up and try to start a
conversation like it's a thing to do, her friends would push
me away and she wouldn't stop them for fear of them
ditching her
>l can't find her on social media
