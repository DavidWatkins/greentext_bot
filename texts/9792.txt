>About 2 years later the guy comes back, wearing armor made out of dragon bones
>Slrangely, he's bleeding out, looks close to death
>Everything stops for a moment, i can't move
>He suddenly heals back up to perfect health and gets even more built
>He hands me the bone crown like it's nothing

>He crouches down right in front of me
>Oh luck where did he go
>Look at guard next to me
>Ol't shit
>He's now naked, holding an apple pie and wearing some stupid jester hat
>Asshole reappears in front of me, strangely wearing the guard's armor
>Eh it's probablyjust my imagination
>Send him on some bullshit raiding missions against winter muslims
>Pray to the divines he gets murdered out there
