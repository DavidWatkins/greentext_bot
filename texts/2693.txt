>Man I wish I was born in the 20105 when thejob
market wasn't automated
>Fucking millennials ruined everything.
>Why the fuck did millennials automate so much
shit? How am I supposed to find work?
>Why couldn't I have been born in the 2010's
where all you needed to get a qt wife was a 6 figure
salary. Now you need fucking rich parents that
edited your genetics in the womb using CRISPR
and gave you the best possible physical features
as well as top tier intelligence.
>wa that you never had a chance in life because
you were born in 2045
>Why the fuck wasn't i born in the 908? Life is
fucking suffering now, there is no point in anything,
at least millennials could get a job or another
means of making money.
