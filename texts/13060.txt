15 6 kB JPG about what nerf guns we had, and we
' would have nerd wars after school n' shit
>it was all pretty good fun and games,
in fact, some of my best childhood
memories are those nerf wars we would
have
>but then we were introduced to the
sharpshooting side of it by our older
brothers, most of them 11 or 12 at the
time
>weeks go by and nerf bros are talking
about their nerf guns firing speed, what
targets they can hit on their house like
the ceiling fan and in the square above a
basketball hoop
>Then one day, while building a nerd gun
to hit the windchime on our porch from
the backyard fence, I see my dog playing
in the grass, and I first notice his large,
red asshole
>lt was red and had a hole in the center.
I thought to myself it'd make a perfect
target
>take a shot at it from the porch
>Yuppie Kai yay mufucka
>direct hit. Dog lets out a yelp in surprise
>Tell my friends about the new nerd
game I came up with.
>They love it
>Spend the next few weeks shooting
are dogs and cats assholes. We were so
fucking cruel to use the fastest firing nerf
guns we had.
>after MONTHS of doing this, all our
pets have to go to the vet because of
repeated hits to the anus
>mfw I never see a nerf gun again after
that
