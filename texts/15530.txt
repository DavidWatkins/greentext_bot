This reminds me of something I read from the
Bush War
>Rhodies recover enemy rifles after each
engagement
>They keep finding rifles with the rear sight dialed
in to the highest setting, practically fucking
indirect fire
>They are extremely confused by this
>Eventually they ask a prisoner about it during
interrogation
>Literally none of them know what the sights are
for, they think that choosing the bigger number
makes the gun shoot harder
Warfare in Africa is truly unbelievable
