And then she drops the bomb that she regularly
flirts and isnt necessarily committed to one person
at a time when shes not in a exclusive relationship.
Now that isnt really a problem given that shes
single and Im single, but I told her from the jump
that I wanted to be exclusive before we put a label
on anything. She tells me that theres this other guy
that she has been talking to for a while BEFORE
ME and she doesntjust want to let him go out of
nowhere even though he doesnt really reciprocate
her feelings.

I told her I cant roll like that. l

1K" "7 be put on the back burner and
237 KB pNG have someone else be prioritized
over me. You cant just play Build A
Nigga and give me bullshit about how you like
different aspects of us combined. Im not some
polygamist faggot.

feeling him like she was feeling me

the phone. we havent spoken for a week
I shouldve listened to you guys. Normal life is a
minefield of inevitable self sabotage and social
disasters. The only time Ive ever gotten attention
from a girl and she ends up playing me like a bitch.
Ive been wondering if lm in the wrong. maybe?
Should I give her a chance and just see where shit
goes? lm very prideful and I get jealous so easily so
I dont want to put my ego on the line like that. If
things dont end up working out for her and this
other maricon I kinda want to reject her. Just to feel
better about the whole situation. really. Apologies
for the sloppily thrown together spic Pepe, by the
way.
Any thoughts? Thanks for reading this. Sorry if it
was anticlimactic but i just needed to tell someone.
