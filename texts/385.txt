That was two years ago and the pain
is still the same as it was the dayfsl
it happened. This has been especially
bothering me today because my
daughter would have been 6 today.
I've been browsing this board for the
last few years and I just wanted to say
that I love you all feven the trolls that
will post herei and enjoyed the time I
spent on this site. Honestly, my fondest
memories are of threads on this board.
As for me, later tonight I'm planning on
committing suicide at a creek I used
to take the kids to. i'm guessing my
friends and family will know why I did it.
See you on the other side, lr9kl.
Also, pic related. It's my wife and
daughter about a month before my
daughter died.
