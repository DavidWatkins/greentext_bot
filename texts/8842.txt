So what happened to you today robots?
So this random guy... I guess
he's on my scriptures class I i
don't really know ' .
ls
Aquwardly shuffles up to me
after class
And he looks and me and says
"I've been watching you for a
while and I think ur really cute
do u wanna go out with me"
And me in my still basically dt'ydi'h
comatose state had the great
idea to ask him "who are you"
instead of saying sorry I have a
bf
The crushed look on his face
l'm a horrible person
But it's just so funny when i
think about it a
I told him no but who says
"who are u to a confession
