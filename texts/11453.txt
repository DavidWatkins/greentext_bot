>th didn't know what to do
>ended up buying several shirts with different
members of the Scooby Doo gang fFred, Daphne,
Scrappy etcl on them, and now I always wear them
at the gym
>all of the exercises I do are related to solving
mysteries
>for example my 'cardio' is to run in one of the
front doors then run through the back of the gym
and come through a back door, like I am Scooby
and the Gang running from a monster through the
different doors
>Instead of deadlifts I do 'Jinkies Jacks' where I
lift the bar until it is too heavy then loudly say
'Jinkies' and drop it
>always wear a zombie mask that I pull off
between sets
I can't stop because people really like it, and I don't
want to become hated, but I am making no gains.
