And you deal with it day in and day out because its a
business and if you want to survive you will eat that shit
and smile knowing full well that selling your wares and
even believing in the 2A as much as you can wont stop
some of the mouth breathers you call customers from
doing something stupid and causing the ATF's cock
alreadyjammed up your ass to start jumping around and
making your life more difficult than it already is.
