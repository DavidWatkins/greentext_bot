>one day I see a beautiful girl taking her poo in one
of the designated poo streets.
>start seeing her quite often as she must do her
poos at roughly the same time everyday as I am
walking to work.
>some days she notices me but most days I just
look at her beautiful body, hair and face as she is
squatting in the street.
>I am too shy to talk to her, so I start waiting until
she finishes and I secretly take a small amount of
her poo to work with me.
>before you judge me, please know why I did that.
Sure, maybe you say, it was just poo. Its true. It
looked like poo and smelt like poo. But it was hers.
>several more months went by, and I was still
thinking how to talk to her.
>finally I worked up the courage and I had a plan
>I put a cork into my bottom, and didn't poo that day,
so the next morning I really needed to go.
>unfortunately she was not there that day, but I
persisted.
>it only took 3 days of this strategy and I found her
there.
>I squatted beside her, and we poo'd together.
>before she could finish her poo and leave I had
introduced myself and while I finished pooing before
her, I remained squatted over my poo so that I could
continue talking to her fand before you ask, yes I
used my hand to wipe my poo from my bottom, but
we always wash our hand at the first opportunity we
get>
>next I tell her about my poo street, and how it is
much nicer and not far away.
>she said quite eagerly that she would like to see it.
>I told herthat I would be late for work ifI showed
her now but if she could arrive 20 minutes earlier
tomorrow, then I could take her there.
>the next day I meet her at her designated poo street
and take her to my much nicer poo street.
