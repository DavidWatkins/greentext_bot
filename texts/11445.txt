This. The suicide statistic for pre-op and post-op
trans individuals is exactly the same. The surgeries
do not work. We need to push for comprehensive
psychiatric research into the development of a
medication to combat feelings of gender dysphoria.
We have to treat this like any other mental disorder.

No. This is a disease like any other. It makes the
victim think the disease is a natural part of
themselves. Depressed and schizophrenic people
do not go and get body parts Iopped off because
they want to find themselves or to feel comfortable
in their bodies. They are given medication that
suppresses the chemical imbalances that cause
their symptoms. Gender dysphoria is in the DSM-V,
we need to treat it as such.
