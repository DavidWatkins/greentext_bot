>None of his classmates iiked him because of his stupidity and
clumsiness, especially his teacher, who was always yelling at
him, "You're driving me mad, Tyrone."
>One day Tyrone's mom came to school to check on how he
was doing. The teacher told his mom honestly, that her son
was simply a disaster, getting very low marks, and that she had
never had she seen such a stupid boy in her entire teaching
career. The mom was shocked at the feedback and withdrew
her son from school and moved out of Detroit . relocating to
Cleveland .
>25 years later, the teacher was diagnosed with an almost
incurable cardiac disease. All the doctors strongly advised her
to have heart surgery, which only one surgeon at the Cleveland
Clinic could perform. Left with no other options, the teacher
decided to have the operation, which was successful.
>When she opened her eyes after the surgery she saw a
handsome young doctor smiling down at her. She wanted to
thank him, but could not talk. Her face started to turn blue, she
raised her hand, trying to tell him something but quickly died.
The doctor was shocked. wondering what went wrong so
suddenly. Then he turned around and saw our friend Tyrone, a
Janitor in the Clinic, who had unplugged the lifessupport
equipment in order to connect his vacuum cleaner.
>Donlt tell me you thought Tyrone had become a heart-
sturgeon.
