>Old guy with a WW2-era service cap on
walks in, doing the old-guy-shuffle, and asks
to see our 1911's
>Then he wants to see our sole M1 Garand
>He's disappointed that it's too heavy for
him now
>Goes back to the 191 1'5
>I get him set up with a nice one, he likes the
sights and says it reminds him of his old gun
he carried back in the clay
>Asian guy comes in with his kid, who is
maybe eight years old
>Kid is drooling over the 191 1'3 while his dad
talks to our gunsmith about boresighting his
rifle
>Kid politely asks to see the 1911 the old
man just bought
>Old man says sure, explains the safety
rules, and bends down to hand the gun to
him
>Kid is awed by the gun, old man chuckles
and pats him on the back as he takes his
pistol back
>"You know, I think I bayonetted your
grandpa at Guadalcanal. Spilled his guts all
over my boots. I'll never forget the way he
screamed."
>Old man smiles and waves at us as he
walks out the door, leaving the Asian kid
staring at him with wide eyes
>Dad can't figure out why his kid is crying
and I'm trying not to lose it
