Here's what you should do
You should go to a store, purchase a handgun, take
it home, and then kill yourself you poor excuse of a
human being
If you hate the dog so much then give it to someone
you know or give her to a rescue. Don't abuse your
poor dog you sick fuck.

If you couldn't train a dog at 14 without being told
how you have to be some kind of retarded. Could
have picked up a book.
