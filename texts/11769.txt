They eventually found the guy drrvrng way over the speed limit wtth the described truck wtth back wtfldnw shattered and bird shot
marks all over the back of his truck. When they searched hrs car they found a few rolls of duct tape, a knife, and some weed. My
parents were two when they found out and shelled out a few grand to install security systems and bars on our windows even though
we lived in a decent neighborhood
