>Dream ends
Now, the the one that I still cannot comprehend:
>Be me, with somebody without a face that i think, or feel, is a friend
>We are in the countryside and know that we have to hunt some kind of animal
>This animal looks like a small deer, kinda like bambi
>We have no guns, and my unrecognizable friend tells me to "keep it yellow"
>Tums out that these deers have yelow coloured shit
