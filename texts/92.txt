LONG AGO IN A DISTANT KITCHEN
I, SNAKUT THE SHAPE-SHIFTING MASTER OF TABLE MESS
UNLEASHED AN UNSPEAKABLE REFILL
BUT, A FOOLISH SAMURAI COOK
WIELDING A MAGIC SUB
STEPPED FORTH T0 OPPOSE ME
BUT BEFORE THE FINAL TOPPING WAS SET
I TORE OPEN A PORTAL IN THYME
AND FLUNG HIM INTO THE MEAT LOCKER
WHERE MY REFILLS ARE LAW
NOW THE FOOL SEEKS TO RETURN TO THE KITCHEN
AND UNDO THE RESTAURANT THAT IS SNAKU
