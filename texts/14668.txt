>Group of shit-smeared half-
starved Chad gypsies pops out of the bushes
>"Hey loser, give us all your gold if you wanna live"
>Chuckle to myself while stroking my beard
>These normies are about to taste the power of the
esoteric arts
>Vanish the ground beneath their feet
>They all fall into a hole
>Cast the Storm of Pe'Pe
>Poo poo and pee pee descend furiously upon the
Chads
>They beg for mercy as I laugh a full belly laugh,
leaving them to a slow and agonizing death by
drowning
>Find their encampment
>Their Stacy wives and children are hiding,
doubtlessly waiting for their return
>Unleash a torrent of magical fire on their huts
>Dance a little jig in happiness as the screams and
lamentations of the normies fill the air around me
>Steal all their precious tendies
>Continue my journey
>I am a wizard
