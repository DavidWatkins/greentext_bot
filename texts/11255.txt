Can't wait for this bitch to get back from vacation, I am
absolutely going to beat the shit out of her.
Thinking about just asking her to marry me so we can be
infected together. She's hot and actually cool so maybe
not the worst ending.
She gets back in 2 weeks.
Any anons out there with herpes stories? Feeling pretty
fucked up right now about it.
