>dragging a ladder through the desert with rapey
coyotes and no water
>seismic sensors alert ground stations
>FLIR enabled drones track your movements
easily, even in the dark of night, silently from 15000
feet
>border patrol is alerted to your presence half a day
before you begin climbing
>wait patiently in the other side with cuffs
>now youlre tired, thirsty, hungry, raped, in custody,
and your ladder has been impounded
Good plan taconigger.
