>went camping this weekend with my gf
>it was her first time camping since she
m was a kid
>she was so excited and kept thanking me
for taking her
>we hiked up to a nice spot by a lake with
962 KB G'F forestry surrounding it
>picked a nice flat grassy spot sheltered from the wind
>we went swimming and I boiled some water so we could
wash and shampoo each other's hair
>she cooked me a nice dinner using herbs etc that she had
brought along tshe was in charge of foodi
>after dinner we sat on a log and stared at the fire with her
head on my shoulder
>th it started raining and we had to rush to the tent and
bring some stuff inside
>we both couldn't stop laughing because it was raining so
heavily and we were out in the wilderness together
>when the rain died down we lay there snuggled up and
whispered about our past, our families, our old friends, our
hopes and ambitions for the future, and what we liked about
one another
>we both got sleepy and she leaned over to kiss me before
we fell asleep
>woke up just as she was about to kiss me
>laid in my sleeping bag for a while in my tiny rented room,
in my slum-tier apartment building, in a huge noisy polluted
city in which I know noone, alone as I have always been,
alone as I will always be
