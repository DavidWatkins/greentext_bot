>Her hair so soft
>Her eyes so blue
>I knew just what she wanted to do
>Her skin so soft
>Her legs so fine
>l ran my fingers
>Down her spine
>I didn't know how but i tried my best
>To place my hand on her breasts
>l remember my fear
>lVly fast beating heart
>But slowly she spread her legs apart
>And when she did it I felt no shame
>All at once
>The white stuff came
>At last it's finished
>Itls all over now
>lVly first time milking a cowl
