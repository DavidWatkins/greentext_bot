"Fuck ME? No, sorry, I don't want to join your little orgy later. And what are you doing
interested in someone my age, anyway?"

>What does cancer have to so with any of this?
That skinny little shit? He is cancer. He sees someone who won't fight back, he sees
someone he can consume. And yet, here you sit, acting like he's a minor headache.
>"minor headache"

come through this park every day You can wait on this bench to fuck him up.

>i nearly cried. I felt so pathetic
>Frank comes up to me and says the nicest shit:
"You are doing incredibly well, very few people actually run as long as they can, but I
can tell by how exhausted you are that you are actually trying, rest on the bench, and
then when you're rested you can try this again, alright?"
