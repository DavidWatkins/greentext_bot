>Mom takes me into my parents'
bathroom and tells me she needs
to tell me something
>She tells me that I'm something
called "uncircumcised" and that,
while Dad wanted it that way, she
didn't

have to pull the foreskin back
until it stays back
>Agree since I'm not really sure
what's happening
>Try to pull back skin a few times
>Pain is incredible
>Unbeknownst to me. I had
phimosis and the skin wasn't
meant to go back
>Rip and tear on the skin for
months
>Soap and shit gets into the little

I read about in an encyclopedia
