>Sure enough, I knock on the door, his mother lets me in, I open the door
and there is C, sprawled out in his armchair, dead and covered in flies with
maggots crawling in his mouth and eyes
>l've never seen or even smelled a dead human body before so I'm
shocked
>l'm still in shock at this point, this happened 4 hours ago
>l scramble to think of what to do because there is weed laying
everywhere and a pipe
>Eventually call 911 and break the news to his mother
>This is one of the worst parts, having to break the news to his mother
over and over and over because she doesn't even know what day it is
>Where is C?
>He's passed away
>What happened?
>They don't know yet fobvious heart attacky
>Do l have to go live in a home now?
>Yes, but they will take care of you
>l had to answer these questions atleast 20 times in about a 3 hour span,
and every time it reminded me that this guy I cared about is gone forever
>The real worst part was the smell
>lt wasn't just the fact that it was a rotting body, it was that my I'm
smelling a dead body plus the familiar smell of the house I'd spent so
much time in
>l'll never forget the smell. I had to sit inside the house trying not to vomit
for 3 hours to comfort his mother who had no idea what happened and is
now being forced into a retirement home
I still haven't really processed everything yet but I will miss my friend who
drank himself to death because of depression. I hope he's in a better place
now
