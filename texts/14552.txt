> Professor says we are learning about processors
> She puts on a youtube playlist
> After 40 minutes of garbage content a decent
looking vid comes on
> Its an English guy who is going really in depth
about the subject
> The teacher looks at us with a funny face
> She mutters "Sorry, I usually try to find videos in
English. I don't speak any British.
> Silence ensues
> The prof asks "Wait you can all understand him?
> She tries telling us we were smart and most people
can't understand "British"
> Everyone looks around awkwardly
> She puts on another garbage playlist and says
nothing for the rest of class
> I fucking paid money to be in her class...
