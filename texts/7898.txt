If I don't go along with everything she says how she
likes it
>she flips
if I don't show her extensively how much she
means to me and be extremely affectionate at all
times

manic depressive suicidal annorexic bipolar
schizophrenic and days from killing herself from
malnutrition and fatigue.
She lets every thing ever get the best of her and
has to live always irrationally seeing the worst of
every situation. Her personality suffering yet
complete unwillingness to improve has made me
resent her as a person and I've grown to feel more
hate and aggression than love and affection for her.
If I say fuck it and go she will DEFINITELY kill her
self and get everyone to blame me.
Wat do?
