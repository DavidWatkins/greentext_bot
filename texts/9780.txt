>like not even some juggalo or joker cosplayer,
an actual clown that you'd see at a carnival
>he checks in and goes to the freeweight section
>picks up two 20 pound dumbbells and starts fucking
juggling them
>everyone stares in awe
>one ofthe employees asks him to please stop because he
could hurt someone
>agrees and drops one on his foot, starts screaming in a
high pitched voice
>employee asks if he's ok
>he lets out a chuckle, honks his nose and takes off hos size
19 shoe to reveal he's fine
>employee sighs and tries to find the manager
>by the time she comes back the clown is on the squat rack
doing 3pl8 ATF reps
>he notices her and the manager out of the corner of his eye
and smiles
>his pants conveniently rip and he shits out three hackey
sacks and a circus peanut
i fucking hate these gym clowns i wish they would just go
away
