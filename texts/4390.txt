>"Shaken. not stirred"
t '
t k I got curious and wanted to know if
i there was an actual difference
y between shaking a martini and
71 KB JPG stirring it.
I thought it wouldn't matter, since you're just mixing
the ingredients. but apparently a study was
conducted to determine if the preparation of a
martini had any influence on its antioxidant
capacity:
the study found that shaken gin martinis were able
to break down hydrogen peroxide and leave only
0.07206 of the peroxide behind. while the stirred gin
martini left behind 0.157Vo of the peroxide.
Based on this information I have concluded that for
James Bond to be able to detect a difference this
small. he must be massively autistic.
