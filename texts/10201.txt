>It's fucking with my throws and is really annoying
>After a few rounds fling the fucking ball at a wall
and leave because it's so fucking annoying
Example no.2:
>Playing vidya on PC
>PC keeps making a weird alert-noise
>Probablyjust something bugged and constantly
losing connectionrreconnecting
>After like the 10th time throw my fucking headset
at the wall, smack the shit out of my PC and
keyboard
>Punch a fucking hole into a wall
Everything like this gets me so fucking angry to a
point where I feel urge to just fucking murder a
person.
