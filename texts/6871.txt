Posted this on M a few years ago the day it happened:
>Sandy Hook shootings just happened
>the teacher was discussing school shootings and social media with the rest of the class
>went on to explain how school shooters are always Ioners. bullied. keep to themselves. etc.
>immediately after she said that. the whole class glanced at me
>teacher quickly changes the subject. realizing what happened
Easily the most uncomfortable moment in my life.
