Here's the only funny one I have. Everything else is
futuristic horror and one particularly fucked up one
I've posted before.
>So I'm at a gym, hitting on the receptionist, but
she's having none of it. Suddenly, I realize I'm at the
gym. I'm a lazy skinnyfat DYEL, I'm never at the
gym. So remembering advice from the internet, I try
to deadlift myself off the ground. I found myself
floating in the air, and based on that I figured out I
was in my first lucid dream. I try to get back on the
ground so I could hypnotize the receptionist into
fucking me, but I'm too weak - I keep flying around
and I don't have the abdominal muscles to control
myself. I wake up and realize at nothing would have
happened anyway because I'm a virgin, bl I wasted
my first lucid dream, and cl girls don't even want
me in my dreams.
