In short, he was the biggest asshole you could
think of. Now everyone, friends and family,
is mourning him like he's the victim. Like
somehow he's a tragic figure who didn't know
any better. And as if what happened to him
was unfortunate and dolor. Even though, I can
promise you with every sense of my being, he
was literally one of the worst people you could
meet, and honestly deserved to be tortured
and mutilated alive, instead of suicide. And
somehow I'm the asshole here.
Why the fuck do we even show empathy to
these kind of fuckheads?
