> doctor writes a
prescription
Should I take the pills? I'd rather get the
over-the-counter stuff. I'm paranoid about
taking anything strong daily from the
pharma jew since that stuff alters your
body chemistry and makes you dependent.
My whole family thinks I should take the
prescription but I don't want to.
