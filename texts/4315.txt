soon as he wakes up he must stulf his face with hardoned com syrup cake
in milk. He has been gaining weight and is unhappy with how he looks. he
doesn't tool as wall as he used to and minor pains bring him fear for reasons
unknown to him. He knows he should do better, but he cant.
He has his cigarette once an hour. As soon as he puts one out his anxiety
raises until he needs another one. His lungs feel heavy when he wakes up
and he cant run.

elfortlessly. he automatically smiles and feels a sense of onioyment. which
will leave him feeling more empty then before Just like the insulin splite from
his morning cereal.

and dopamine saturation nature of pornography, he has required more and
more obscure videos in order to get cit. He is highly specinc in what he
needs. and clicks through some hundreds of videos in a matter of minutes
searching for a brand new video that will accomldate his fetish. He cums and
feels disgusted with himself,
That night his girlfriend asks him again why he never wants to sleep with her.
He says he has just been tired lately. He has been conditioning his brain to
porn every day for many years. He is completely desensitized to normal
reward mechanisms.
To feel truely good is to live morally. which is the same as to be free.
