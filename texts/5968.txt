>Fast forward 10 years
>Meet asshole again on class reunion
>"Yeah, Anon, you were a weirdo, so you deserved it,

>That seals it
>Back home I look up his Facebook and take one of
his more presentable photos
>Use muh Photoshop Magic to turn it into a
presentable photo for applications
>Know he wants to become a mechanic
>Send his "application" to every mechanic in a 100
km radius
>Literally every fucking workshop, factory, garage,
what have you
>Takes about two months and a small fortune in
stamps
>Heres the kicker:
>The application "outed" him as a member of a
hardcore left-wing union that no employer in their
right mind would hire
>He gets rejected from all of them of course
>Doesn't get letters saying so, because the return
address is a mailbox I set up for this very purpose
>Find out asshole moved
>Repeat the process
>He will most likely move again
>I have no intention of stopping this
