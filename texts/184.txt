>be me
>standing in the dark room
>hungry and longing
>reach for the door
>slowly open it wide
>Iook at the prey
>it's just lying there
>reach for it
>feel the touch of the soft, cold skin
>hardens the drooling of the mouth
>want to bite in it
>the teeth slowly penetrate the flesh as the red
liquid is trickling down the chin
>it's so good
>bite again, and again
>tearing it
>this is what makes you feel alive
>this beautiful tomato
