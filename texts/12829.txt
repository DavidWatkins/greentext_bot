>11 years old
>Get grounded
>Parents take console away
>Eventually find out where they hide it
>Take it out whenever I get back from school since
they're both working, put it back when it starts getting
close to the time they get home from work
>Do this for a while, don't even care that I'm grounded
anymore
>One night, hear my mom screaming and rush off out
the house
>See this as my chance to take the console out
>Play for a while before I hear the garage door
opening, rush to put the console back in the hiding
spot
>Mom comes in crying
>"Fuck, I didn't close the cupboard door"
>She hugs me, and I try to reach the door to close it
>TeIIs me my dad got in an accident, hes dead
I cried the rest of the night until I passed out, the next
morning she pulled the console out of the cupboard
and let me play it. I still can't forgive myself for taking
advantage of that situation.
