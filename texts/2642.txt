>You will never place your soul into a phylaotery
and become immortal
>You will never resurrect your dead loved ones
>You will never run at the speed of sound
>You will never walk in the shadows as if they were a path atop a bottomless
canyon
>You will never see through the eyes of another person
>You will never turn wood to gold
>You will never breathe water as if it were air
>You will never enchant a ring to keep you from feeling sick
>You will never walk on water
>You will never pull a pillar from the ground beneath your feet and rain hellfire
on legions of your foes
>You will never cut holes in your hat to give your knife ears room to breathe
Why even live?
